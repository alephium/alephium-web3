  "summary": "This code defines a function called `deployAndSaveProgress` that deploys a smart contract and saves the deployment progress. The function takes two arguments: `configuration` and `networkId`. \n\nThe `configuration` argument is an object that contains settings for the deployment process. The `networkId` argument is an identifier for the network on which the smart contract will be deployed. \n\nThe function first gets the path to the deployment file using the `getDeploymentFilePath` function. It then creates a `Deployments` object from the deployment file using the `Deployments.from` function. \n\nThe `deploy` function is then called with the `configuration`, `networkId`, and `deployments` arguments. This function deploys the smart contract and updates the `deployments` object with the deployment progress. If an error occurs during deployment, the function catches the error, saves the deployment progress to the deployment file, logs an error message, and rethrows the error. \n\nAfter successful deployment, the function saves the deployment progress to the deployment file using the `deployments.saveToFile` function. The third argument of this function is a boolean that indicates whether to overwrite the existing deployment file or append to it. In this case, it is set to `true` to overwrite the file. \n\nFinally, the function logs a success message to the console. \n\nThis function is likely used in the larger project to automate the deployment process of smart contracts. It provides a convenient way to deploy a contract and save the deployment progress in a file for future reference. Here is an example of how this function might be used:\n\n```\nimport { Configuration } from '../src/types'\nimport { deployAndSaveProgress } from '../src/deployer'\nimport { NetworkId } from '@alephium/web3'\n\nconst configuration: Configuration = {\n  // configuration settings for deployment\n}\n\nconst networkId: NetworkId = 'mainnet'\n\ndeployAndSaveProgress(configuration, networkId)\n  .then(() => console.log('Deployment complete!'))\n  .catch(error => console.error(error))\n```",
