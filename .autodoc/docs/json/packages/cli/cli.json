  "summary": "This code is a Node.js script that serves as an entry point for the Alephium command-line interface (CLI). The CLI is a tool that allows users to interact with the Alephium blockchain network through a terminal interface. \n\nThe script first checks if the user has run the CLI with the correct command prefix. If not, it prints an error message and exits. If the prefix is correct, the script extracts the command arguments from the command line arguments and constructs a new command to execute. \n\nThe constructed command uses the `ts-node` package to execute a TypeScript file called `cli_internal.ts`. This file contains the actual implementation of the CLI commands. The `ts-node` package allows TypeScript files to be executed directly without the need for compilation to JavaScript. \n\nThe `execSync` function from the `child_process` module is used to execute the constructed command synchronously. The `stdio` option is set to `'inherit'` to allow the child process to use the same standard input/output streams as the parent process. The `cwd` and `env` options are set to the current working directory and environment variables of the parent process, respectively. \n\nOverall, this script serves as a bridge between the user's command-line input and the actual implementation of the Alephium CLI commands. It allows users to interact with the Alephium blockchain network through a familiar terminal interface. \n\nExample usage:\n```\nnpx @alephium/cli@latest version\n```\nThis command will print the version of the Alephium CLI.",
