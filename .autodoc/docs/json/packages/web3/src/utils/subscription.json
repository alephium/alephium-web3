  "summary": "This file contains TypeScript code that defines a Subscription class and related interfaces. The Subscription class is an abstract class that provides a framework for creating objects that can subscribe to and receive messages from a remote server. The class is designed to be extended by other classes that implement the specific details of the subscription.\n\nThe Subscription class has several properties and methods that are used to manage the subscription. The pollingInterval property specifies the time interval between polling requests to the server. The messageCallback property is a callback function that is called when a message is received from the server. The errorCallback property is a callback function that is called when an error occurs during the subscription.\n\nThe startPolling method is used to start the subscription. It sets up an event listener that triggers a polling request to the server at the specified polling interval. If the subscription has not been cancelled, the event listener sets up another polling request after the specified interval has elapsed.\n\nThe unsubscribe method is used to cancel the subscription. It removes the event listener and sets a cancelled flag to true. If there is a polling task scheduled, it is cancelled using the clearTimeout method.\n\nThe SubscribeOptions interface is used to specify the options for creating a Subscription object. It includes the polling interval, message callback, and error callback.\n\nThe MessageCallback and ErrorCallback types are used to define the callback functions for the message and error events.\n\nThis code is part of the alephium-web3 project and can be used to create subscription objects that can receive messages from a remote server. For example, a developer could create a new class that extends the Subscription class and implements the polling method to make requests to a specific API endpoint. The messageCallback method could then be used to process the response data and update the application state accordingly.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a TypeScript abstract class `Subscription` and an interface `SubscribeOptions` with a few methods and properties that can be used to implement a polling-based subscription system.\n\n2. What is the license for this code?\n- This code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `MessageCallback` and `ErrorCallback` types?\n- The `MessageCallback` type is a function that takes a `Message` parameter and returns a `Promise` that resolves to `void`. It is used to handle incoming messages from the subscription.\n- The `ErrorCallback` type is a function that takes an `error` and a `Subscription` parameter and returns a `Promise` that resolves to `void`. It is used to handle errors that occur during the subscription."
