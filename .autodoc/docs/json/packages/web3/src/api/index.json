  "summary": "This code exports various modules and functions from the alephium-web3 project. The purpose of this file is to make these modules and functions available for use in other parts of the project or in external projects that depend on alephium-web3.\n\nThe `export` statements at the beginning of the file allow other files to import these modules and functions using the `import` statement. For example, if another file in the project needs to use the `node` module, it can import it like this:\n\n```\nimport { node } from 'alephium-web3'\n```\n\nThis will give the file access to all the functions and variables exported from the `api-alephium` module.\n\nSimilarly, the `export * from` statements allow other files to import all the exported modules and functions from this file using a single import statement. For example, if another file needs to use all the modules and functions exported from this file, it can import them like this:\n\n```\nimport * as alephiumWeb3 from 'alephium-web3'\n```\n\nThis will give the file access to all the exported modules and functions, which can be accessed using the `alephiumWeb3` object.\n\nOverall, this file serves as a central point for exporting all the important modules and functions from the alephium-web3 project, making them easily accessible for use in other parts of the project or in external projects that depend on alephium-web3.",
