      "summary": "This code defines a class called `ExplorerProvider` that acts as a wrapper around an instance of the `ExplorerApi` class. The `ExplorerApi` class is imported from another file in the same directory, along with some utility functions. The `ExplorerProvider` class provides a simplified interface for interacting with the Alephium blockchain explorer API.\n\nThe `ExplorerProvider` constructor takes three optional parameters: `baseUrl`, `apiKey`, and `customFetch`. If `baseUrl` is provided, a new instance of `ExplorerApi` is created with the specified base URL, API key, and custom fetch function. If a `Provider` object is provided instead, the `ExplorerProvider` instance is created as a copy of the provided object. If an `ApiRequestHandler` function is provided, the `ExplorerProvider` instance is created with a base URL of `https://1.2.3.4:0` and all requests are forwarded to the provided handler.\n\nThe `ExplorerProvider` class has several properties that correspond to different endpoints of the Alephium blockchain explorer API, such as `blocks`, `transactions`, `addresses`, `infos`, `mempool`, `tokens`, `charts`, `contracts`, and `contractEvents`. Each of these properties is an object that contains methods for interacting with the corresponding API endpoint.\n\nThe `ExplorerProvider` class also has a `request` method that takes an `ApiRequestArguments` object and returns a Promise that resolves to the response from the API. This method is used internally by the other methods of the class, but can also be used directly to make custom requests to the API.\n\nFinally, the `ExplorerProvider` class has two static methods: `Proxy` and `Remote`. The `Proxy` method takes an `ExplorerProvider` instance and returns a new instance that is a copy of the original instance, but with all properties set to read-only. This can be used to prevent the original instance from being modified. The `Remote` method takes an `ApiRequestHandler` function and returns a new `ExplorerProvider` instance that forwards all requests to the provided handler.\n\nOverall, this code provides a convenient and flexible way to interact with the Alephium blockchain explorer API in a TypeScript project. By using the `ExplorerProvider` class, developers can easily make requests to different API endpoints and handle responses in a type-safe manner.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n   - This code defines a class called `ExplorerProvider` that provides access to various APIs related to the Alephium blockchain. It also includes a function called `initializeExplorerApi` that initializes an instance of the `ExplorerApi` class with a given base URL and API key.\n\n2. What is the license for this code and where can I find more information about it?\n   - This code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later. More information about this license can be found at <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n3. What are the parameters for the `ExplorerProvider` constructor and how are they used?\n   - The `ExplorerProvider` constructor can take a base URL, API key, and custom fetch function as parameters. It can also take an instance of `ExplorerProvider` or `ApiRequestHandler` as a single parameter. These parameters are used to initialize an instance of the `ExplorerApi` class and set up the various APIs that the `ExplorerProvider` class provides access to."

      "summary": "This file contains utility functions for making HTTP requests to an API and handling rate limiting and retries. The functions are designed to be used in the larger Alephium project, which likely involves interacting with an external API.\n\nThe `convertHttpResponse` function takes an HTTP response object and returns the data from the response. If the response contains an error, it throws an error with the error detail message.\n\nThe `retryFetch` function takes the same parameters as the built-in `fetch` function and attempts to make a request. If the response status is 429 (Too Many Requests), the function waits for a certain amount of time and retries the request up to a certain number of times. This is useful for handling rate limiting from the API. The function returns a promise that resolves to the response object.\n\nThe `throttledFetch` function takes a rate limit in requests per second and returns a custom `fetch` function that is rate-limited and retries requests as necessary. The function uses the `RateLimit` class from the `async-sema` library to limit the rate of requests. The returned function has the same parameters as the built-in `fetch` function and returns a promise that resolves to the response object.\n\nThe constants `RETRY_LIMIT_WHEN_429`, `DEFAULT_RATE_LIMIT`, and `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_FETCH` are also defined in this file. `RETRY_LIMIT_WHEN_429` is the maximum number of times `retryFetch` will retry a request when it receives a 429 response. `DEFAULT_RATE_LIMIT` is the default rate limit used by `throttledFetch`. `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_FETCH` is the default `fetch` function that is rate-limited and retries requests, with a rate limit of `DEFAULT_RATE_LIMIT` requests per second.\n\nOverall, these functions provide a convenient way to make HTTP requests to an API while handling rate limiting and retries. They can be used in the larger Alephium project to interact with an external API in a reliable and efficient manner. Here is an example of how `throttledFetch` might be used:\n\n```\nconst fetch = throttledFetch(5) // limit to 5 requests per second\nconst response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')\nconst data = await convertHttpResponse(response)\nconsole.log(data)\n```",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file contains functions and constants related to making HTTP requests with rate limiting and retry functionality.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `convertHttpResponse` function?\n- The `convertHttpResponse` function takes an HTTP response object and returns its data property if there is no error, or throws an error with the detail property of the error object if there is one.\n\n3. What is the default rate limit for the `throttledFetch` function?\n- The default rate limit for the `throttledFetch` function is 3 requests per second."
