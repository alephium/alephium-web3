      "summary": "This code is a license and an export statement for two modules in the Alephium project's web3 library. The license specifies that the library is free software and can be redistributed or modified under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License. The license also disclaims any warranty and provides a link to the full license text.\n\nThe export statement is used to make the contents of two modules available to other parts of the project. The first module, `status`, likely contains functions or classes related to the status of the Alephium network or nodes. The second module, `sign-verify`, likely contains functions or classes related to signing and verifying transactions or messages on the Alephium network.\n\nThis code is important for the Alephium project because it ensures that the web3 library is licensed appropriately and that the necessary modules are available for use in other parts of the project. Developers working on the project can import these modules and use their functions or classes to interact with the Alephium network. For example, a developer might use the `sign-verify` module to sign a transaction before sending it to the network or use the `status` module to check the current status of a node. \n\nHere is an example of how a developer might use the `sign-verify` module:\n\n```\nimport { signTransaction } from 'alephium-web3/sign-verify'\n\nconst privateKey = '0x123456789abcdef...'\nconst transaction = {\n  to: '0x987654321fedcba...',\n  value: '1000000000000000000',\n  gasPrice: '1000000000',\n  gasLimit: '21000',\n  nonce: '0'\n}\n\nconst signedTransaction = signTransaction(privateKey, transaction)\n```\n\nIn this example, the developer imports the `signTransaction` function from the `sign-verify` module. They then provide a private key and a transaction object, and use the `signTransaction` function to sign the transaction. The resulting signed transaction can then be sent to the Alephium network.",

      "summary": "This file contains two functions that are used for transaction signing and signature verification in the Alephium project. The functions are exported and can be used by other modules in the project.\n\nThe `transactionSign` function takes in a transaction ID and a private key and returns a signature for the transaction. The `keyType` parameter is optional and specifies the type of key being used for signing. The function calls the `sign` function from the `utils` module and passes in the transaction ID, private key, and key type (if provided) as arguments. The `sign` function is responsible for generating the signature using the provided private key and returns it as a string.\n\nHere is an example usage of the `transactionSign` function:\n\n```\nimport { transactionSign } from 'alephium-web3'\n\nconst txId = '0x1234567890abcdef'\nconst privateKey = '0x0123456789abcdef'\nconst keyType = 'secp256k1'\n\nconst signature = transactionSign(txId, privateKey, keyType)\nconsole.log(signature)\n```\n\nThe `transactionVerifySignature` function takes in a transaction ID, a public key, a signature, and an optional key type and returns a boolean indicating whether the signature is valid for the given transaction and public key. The function calls the `verifySignature` function from the `utils` module and passes in the transaction ID, public key, signature, and key type (if provided) as arguments. The `verifySignature` function is responsible for verifying the signature using the provided public key and returns a boolean indicating whether the signature is valid.\n\nHere is an example usage of the `transactionVerifySignature` function:\n\n```\nimport { transactionVerifySignature } from 'alephium-web3'\n\nconst txId = '0x1234567890abcdef'\nconst publicKey = '0x0123456789abcdef'\nconst signature = '0xabcdef0123456789'\nconst keyType = 'secp256k1'\n\nconst isValid = transactionVerifySignature(txId, publicKey, signature, keyType)\nconsole.log(isValid)\n``` \n\nOverall, these functions provide a convenient way to sign and verify transaction signatures in the Alephium project. They can be used by other modules to handle transaction signing and verification without having to implement the logic themselves.",

      "summary": "This file contains TypeScript code that defines a class and a function related to subscribing to transaction status updates in the Alephium blockchain network. The code imports the `web3` and `node` modules from other parts of the `alephium-web3` project, as well as a `Subscription` class and `SubscribeOptions` type from a `utils` module.\n\nThe `TxStatusSubscription` class extends the `Subscription` class and defines a constructor that takes in a `SubscribeOptions` object, a transaction ID string, and optional `fromGroup` and `toGroup` numbers. The `TxStatusSubscription` instance starts polling for transaction status updates as soon as it is created. The `polling` method of the class uses the `web3` module to get the transaction status from the current node provider and calls the `messageCallback` method of the `Subscription` class with the status as an argument. If an error occurs, the `errorCallback` method of the `Subscription` class is called with the error and the `TxStatusSubscription` instance as arguments.\n\nThe `subscribeToTxStatus` function is a wrapper around the `TxStatusSubscription` class constructor that creates and returns a new `TxStatusSubscription` instance with the given arguments.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way for developers to subscribe to transaction status updates in the Alephium blockchain network. The `TxStatusSubscription` class can be used to create a subscription instance that polls for updates and calls a callback function with the status when it changes. The `subscribeToTxStatus` function provides a simpler way to create a subscription by wrapping the `TxStatusSubscription` constructor. This code is likely used in conjunction with other parts of the `alephium-web3` project to build decentralized applications on the Alephium network.",

The `SubscribeOptions` object is used to configure the subscription, while the `txId` string identifies the transaction for which the developer wants to receive status updates. The `fromGroup` and `toGroup` numbers are optional and specify the range of block groups to search for the transaction status."

  "summary": "The code in the `transaction` folder of the `alephium-web3` project provides functionality for handling transactions, signing, verifying signatures, and subscribing to transaction status updates on the Alephium blockchain network. It consists of three main files: `index.ts`, `sign-verify.ts`, and `status.ts`.\n\n`index.ts` exports the contents of the `status` and `sign-verify` modules, making them available for use in other parts of the project. Developers can import these modules to interact with the Alephium network, such as signing a transaction before sending it to the network or checking the current status of a node.\n\n`sign-verify.ts` contains two functions, `transactionSign` and `transactionVerifySignature`, which are used for transaction signing and signature verification. The `transactionSign` function generates a signature for a given transaction ID and private key, while the `transactionVerifySignature` function checks if a given signature is valid for a specific transaction ID and public key. These functions can be used by other modules to handle transaction signing and verification without having to implement the logic themselves.\n\nExample usage of `transactionSign`:\n\n```javascript\nimport { transactionSign } from 'alephium-web3'\n\nconst txId = '0x1234567890abcdef'\nconst privateKey = '0x0123456789abcdef'\nconst keyType = 'secp256k1'\n\nconst signature = transactionSign(txId, privateKey, keyType)\nconsole.log(signature)\n```\n\nExample usage of `transactionVerifySignature`:\n\n```javascript\nimport { transactionVerifySignature } from 'alephium-web3'\n\nconst txId = '0x1234567890abcdef'\nconst publicKey = '0x0123456789abcdef'\nconst signature = '0xabcdef0123456789'\nconst keyType = 'secp256k1'\n\nconst isValid = transactionVerifySignature(txId, publicKey, signature, keyType)\nconsole.log(isValid)\n```\n\n`status.ts` defines a `TxStatusSubscription` class and a `subscribeToTxStatus` function for subscribing to transaction status updates in the Alephium blockchain network. The `TxStatusSubscription` class extends the `Subscription` class and starts polling for transaction status updates as soon as it is created. The `subscribeToTxStatus` function is a wrapper around the `TxStatusSubscription` class constructor that creates and returns a new `TxStatusSubscription` instance with the given arguments.\n\nThis code is likely used in conjunction with other parts of the `alephium-web3` project to build decentralized applications on the Alephium network.
