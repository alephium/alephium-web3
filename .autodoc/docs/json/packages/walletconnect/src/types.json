  "summary": "This file defines several types and interfaces that are used in the Alephium Web3 project. It also imports various modules and constants that are used throughout the project. \n\nThe `RelayMethodsTable` type defines a table of methods that can be called by a relay. Each method has a set of parameters and a result type. The `RelayMethodParams` and `RelayMethodResult` types are used to extract the parameter and result types for a specific method. \n\nThe `ProviderEventArguments` type defines the arguments that can be passed to a provider event. The `ProviderEvent` type is used to specify the type of event that is being handled, and the `ProviderEventArgument` type is used to extract the argument type for a specific event. \n\nThe `AddressGroup` type is used to specify a specific address group or all address groups. The `ChainInfo` interface defines the network ID and address group for a specific chain. \n\nThe `ProjectMetaData` type is used to store metadata about a project. \n\nOverall, this file provides a set of types and interfaces that are used throughout the Alephium Web3 project to ensure type safety and consistency.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this file?\n- This file contains type definitions for various methods and events related to the Alephium web3 library and wallet connectivity.\n\n2. What is the license for this library?\n- The library is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `RelayMethodsTable` type and its associated types?\n- The `RelayMethodsTable` type defines a mapping between method names and their expected parameters and results. The associated types `RelayMethodParams` and `RelayMethodResult` are used to enforce type safety when calling these methods."
