  "summary": "This file contains several constants that are used in the Alephium project. \n\nThe `PROVIDER_NAMESPACE` constant is a string that is used to identify the Alephium provider. This is used in conjunction with the `window.ethereum` object in the browser to allow dApps to interact with the Alephium blockchain.\n\nThe `RELAY_METHODS` constant is an array of strings that represent the methods that can be called on the Alephium relay. The relay is a service that allows users to interact with the Alephium blockchain without running a full node. These methods include functions for signing and submitting transactions, requesting data from the node API, and more.\n\nThe `LOGGER` constant is a string that represents the logging level for the Alephium project. In this case, it is set to 'error', which means that only error messages will be logged.\n\nThe `RELAY_URL` constant is a string that represents the URL for the Alephium relay. This is the endpoint that users will connect to in order to interact with the Alephium blockchain.\n\nOverall, this file contains important constants that are used throughout the Alephium project. These constants help to identify the Alephium provider, define the methods that can be called on the relay, set the logging level, and specify the URL for the relay. These constants are used in various parts of the project to ensure that everything is working together properly. For example, the `PROVIDER_NAMESPACE` constant is used to identify the Alephium provider in the browser, while the `RELAY_METHODS` constant is used to define the methods that can be called on the relay.",
