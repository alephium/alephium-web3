  "summary": "This code is a configuration file for the TypeScript compiler. It specifies the options for compiling TypeScript code into JavaScript code. The file is located in the `alephium-web3` project and is used to compile the project's TypeScript code into JavaScript code that can be executed in a web browser or on a server.\n\nThe `extends` property specifies that this configuration file extends another configuration file located at `./tsconfig.json`. This means that any options specified in the base configuration file will also apply to this file.\n\nThe `compilerOptions` property is an object that contains various options for the TypeScript compiler. The `outDir` property specifies the output directory for the compiled JavaScript code. The `rootDir` property specifies the root directory of the TypeScript source code. The `module` property specifies the module format for the compiled JavaScript code. In this case, it is set to `commonjs`, which is a module format commonly used in Node.js applications. The `importHelpers` property is set to `true`, which enables the TypeScript compiler to use helper functions when compiling certain language features. The `noUnusedLocals` property is set to `false`, which disables the compiler from warning about unused local variables. The `strict` property is set to `false`, which disables strict type checking.\n\nOverall, this configuration file is an important part of the `alephium-web3` project as it specifies how the TypeScript code should be compiled into JavaScript code. Without this file, the project would not be able to run in a web browser or on a server. An example of how this file is used in the project is by running the `tsc` command in the terminal, which compiles the TypeScript code using the options specified in this configuration file.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this configuration file?\n   This configuration file is used to specify compiler options for the alephium-web3 project.\n\n2. What is the significance of the \"outDir\" and \"rootDir\" options?\n   The \"outDir\" option specifies the output directory for compiled files, while the \"rootDir\" option specifies the root directory for input files.\n\n3. Why is the \"strict\" option set to false?\n   The \"strict\" option enables strict type checking and other strict mode features, but it is set to false in this configuration file, possibly to allow for more flexible development."
