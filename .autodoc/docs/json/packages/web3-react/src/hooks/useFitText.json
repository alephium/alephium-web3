  "summary": "The `useFitText` function is a custom React hook that resizes text to fit within a container. It is imported from the `alephium-web3` project and uses the `useCallback`, `useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect`, `useRef`, and `useState` hooks from the React library. The function takes an options object as an argument, which can include the following properties:\n\n- `logLevel`: A string that specifies the level of logging to use. The default value is `'info'`.\n- `maxFontSize`: A number that specifies the maximum font size to use. The default value is `100`.\n- `minFontSize`: A number that specifies the minimum font size to use. The default value is `20`.\n- `onFinish`: A function that is called when the font size has been adjusted to fit the text.\n- `onStart`: A function that is called when the font size adjustment process starts.\n- `resolution`: A number that specifies the resolution of the font size adjustment. The default value is `5`.\n\nThe function returns an object that contains the `fontSize` and `ref` properties. The `fontSize` property is a number that represents the font size that was used to fit the text. The `ref` property is a reference to the container element that the text is contained within.\n\nThe `useFitText` function uses a `ResizeObserver` to monitor changes to the size of the container element. When the size changes, the function recalculates the font size to fit the text. The function uses a binary search algorithm to adjust the font size until the text fits within the container. The `useIsoLayoutEffect` hook is used to suppress warnings when rendering on the server.\n\nThe `useFitText` function can be used in a larger project to dynamically adjust the font size of text to fit within a container. This can be useful for responsive design, where the size of the container may change depending on the size of the screen or the device being used. An example of how to use the `useFitText` function is shown below:\n\n```jsx\nimport useFitText from 'alephium-web3'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const { fontSize, ref } = useFitText()\n\n  return (\n    <div ref={ref}>\n      <p style={{ fontSize: `${fontSize}px` }}>This text will be resized to fit within the container.</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code exports a custom React hook called `useFitText` that resizes text to fit within a container.\n\n2. What are the parameters that can be passed to `useFitText`?\n- The `useFitText` hook accepts an options object with the following optional properties: `logLevel`, `maxFontSize`, `minFontSize`, `onFinish`, `onStart`, and `resolution`.\n\n3. How does `useFitText` determine the appropriate font size for the text?\n- `useFitText` uses a binary search algorithm to adjust the font size based on whether the text overflows the container or not. It also has a `resolution` option to determine how close the font size needs to be to the ideal size before stopping the search."
