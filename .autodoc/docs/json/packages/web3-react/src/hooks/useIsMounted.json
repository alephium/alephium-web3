  "summary": "This code defines a custom React hook called `useIsMounted`. The purpose of this hook is to determine whether a component is currently mounted or not. \n\nThe hook uses the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks from the React library. The `useState` hook initializes a state variable called `mounted` to `false`. The `useEffect` hook is used to update the `mounted` state variable to `true` when the component is mounted. The second argument to `useEffect` is an empty array, which means that the effect will only run once when the component is mounted.\n\nThe `useIsMounted` hook returns the `mounted` state variable, which will be `true` if the component is mounted and `false` otherwise. This can be useful in situations where you need to conditionally render content based on whether a component is mounted or not. For example, you might want to fetch data from an API when a component is mounted, but not when it is unmounted. You could use the `useIsMounted` hook to conditionally fetch the data only when the component is mounted.\n\nHere is an example of how you might use the `useIsMounted` hook in a component:\n\n```\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport useIsMounted from './useIsMounted'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const isMounted = useIsMounted()\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (isMounted) {\n      // Fetch data from API\n    }\n  }, [isMounted])\n\n  return (\n    // Render component\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `useEffect` hook will only fetch data from the API if the component is currently mounted. The `isMounted` variable is passed as a dependency to the `useEffect` hook to ensure that the effect only runs when the `isMounted` value changes.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code exports a custom React hook called `useIsMounted` which returns a boolean value indicating whether the component is mounted or not.\n\n2. What are the dependencies of this code?\n   - This code imports two hooks from the `react` library, `useState` and `useEffect`.\n\n3. What license is this code released under?\n   - This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later."
