  "summary": "The code is a custom React hook that allows a user to subscribe to the status of a transaction on the Alephium blockchain. The hook is designed to be used in a React component and takes two parameters: the transaction ID and a callback function that will be called whenever the transaction status changes. \n\nThe hook uses the `@alephium/web3` library to interact with the Alephium blockchain. It first gets the default Alephium wallet using the `getDefaultAlephiumWallet` function from the `@alephium/get-extension-wallet` library. If the wallet object is not initialized, an error is thrown. The `web3.setCurrentNodeProvider` function is then called to set the node provider to the one provided by the Alephium wallet.\n\nThe hook then creates a subscription to the transaction status using the `subscribeToTxStatus` function from the `@alephium/web3` library. The subscription options are defined in the `subscriptionOptions` object, which includes a polling interval of 3 seconds, a message callback function that updates the transaction status and calls the provided callback function, and an error callback function that logs any errors and unsubscribes from the subscription.\n\nThe hook returns the current transaction status as a state variable, which can be used to render the component based on the current status of the transaction. \n\nHere is an example of how the hook can be used in a React component:\n\n```\nimport { useTxStatus } from './useTxStatus'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const { txStatus } = useTxStatus('0x123456789abcdef')\n\n  if (txStatus === undefined) {\n    return <div>Loading...</div>\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Transaction status: {txStatus.type}</p>\n      <p>Transaction hash: {txStatus.hash}</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `useTxStatus` hook is called with a transaction ID of `0x123456789abcdef`. The component renders a loading message if the transaction status is undefined, and otherwise displays the transaction status and hash. The callback function can also be provided to perform additional actions when the transaction status changes.",
