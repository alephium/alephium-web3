          "summary": "This code defines a React component called `Alert` that can be used to display alerts on a web page. The component takes two props: `children` and `icon`. The `children` prop is used to pass in the content of the alert, while the `icon` prop is used to pass in an optional icon to be displayed alongside the content.\n\nThe `Alert` component is defined using the `React.forwardRef` function, which allows the component to forward a ref to one of its children. This is useful when the component needs to access the DOM node of one of its children, for example to set focus or measure its size.\n\nThe `Alert` component renders a container element with the class `AlertContainer`, which is defined in a separate file. If the `icon` prop is provided, the component also renders an `IconContainer` element with the `icon` prop as its child. Finally, the component renders a `div` element with the `children` prop as its content.\n\nThe `Alert` component is exported as the default export of the module, which means that it can be imported and used in other parts of the project. For example, a parent component could use the `Alert` component to display an error message to the user:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport Alert from 'alephium-web3/Alert'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [error, setError] = React.useState(null)\n\n  function handleButtonClick() {\n    try {\n      // some code that might throw an error\n    } catch (error) {\n      setError(error.message)\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Do something risky</button>\n      {error && <Alert>{error}</Alert>}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MyComponent` function defines a state variable `error` that is initially set to `null`. When the user clicks the button, the component tries to execute some code that might throw an error. If an error is thrown, the component catches it and sets the `error` state variable to the error message. Finally, the component renders an `Alert` component with the `error` message as its content, which is displayed to the user.",

It has a fixed width and height of 24px and is a flex container with its child elements centered both horizontally and vertically. The SVG icon is set to display block and has a width of 100% and height of auto. \n\nThese components are used to create alert messages throughout the Alephium web3 project.

The component then renders a standard HTML `button` element with the appropriate class name, disabled state, and click handler based on the props passed to it. By using the `ButtonProps` interface to define the expected props for the `Button` component, the component can ensure that it only receives valid props and can provide type checking and autocompletion for those props in development environments.",

The `children` prop is used to specify the child components to be rendered.\n\nHere is an example of how the `Portal` component can be used:\n\n```\nimport Portal from './Portal'\n\nconst App = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>My App</h1>\n      <Portal selector=\"#modal\">\n        <div>\n          <h2>Modal</h2>\n          <p>This is a modal.</p>\n        </div>\n      </Portal>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Portal` component is used to render a modal outside of the parent component's DOM hierarchy. The `selector` prop is set to `#modal`, which specifies that the child components should be rendered into an element with an ID of `modal`. If no such element exists, a new element with an ID of `modal` is created and mounted to the body of the document.

This is particularly helpful when you need to render components like modals or tooltips at specific locations in the DOM.\n\nThe component utilizes the `useEffect` hook to check if the specified selector exists in the DOM. If it does, the component is mounted to the existing element. If it does not exist, a new element is created and mounted to the document body. The `useState` hook is used to keep track of the component's mounted state.\n\nThe `createPortal` function from the `react-dom` library is employed to render the child components into the mounted element. This function accepts two arguments: the child components to be rendered and the DOM element to render them into.\n\nThe `Portal` component takes two props: `selector` and `children`.

It also sets the position to relative, height to 40px, padding to 0, line-height to 0, letter-spacing to -0.2px, font-size to 16px, and font-weight to 500. It also sets the text-align to center and applies a transition effect to color, background, box-shadow, and border-radius. \n\nThe `Container` component has two variants, `primary` and `secondary`. The `primary` variant sets the `--color`, `--background`, `--box-shadow`, and `--border-radius` CSS variables to specific values. It also sets the `--hover-color`, `--hover-background`, `--hover-box-shadow`, and `--hover-border-radius` CSS variables to specific values for when the button is hovered over. Similarly, it sets the `--active-color`, `--active-background`, `--active-box-shadow`, and `--active-border-radius` CSS variables to specific values for when the button is clicked. \n\nThe `secondary` variant is similar to the `primary` variant, but it sets different CSS variables for the button's color, background, box-shadow, and border-radius. \n\nThe `ThemeContainer` component is a styled button that sets all CSS properties to initial values and sets the appearance to none. It also sets the user-select to none, position to relative, padding to 0, margin to 0, and background to none.

The `useState` hook is used to manage the `isOpen` state of the tooltip window, which is initially set to `false`. The `useMeasure` hook is used to measure the size and position of the target element and the tooltip window.
