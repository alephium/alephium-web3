  "summary": "This code defines two styled components, `AlertContainer` and `IconContainer`, which are used to create alert messages with icons in the Alephium web3 project. \n\nThe `AlertContainer` component is a container for the alert message and can be customized using CSS variables. It is a flex container with a gap of 8px between its child elements. It has a position of relative and a border radius of 9px. The `padding`, `text-align`, `font-size`, `line-height`, and `font-weight` properties are also set. The `max-width` is set to 260px and the `min-width` is set to 100%. The component also has CSS variables for `border-radius`, `color`, `background`, and `box-shadow` which can be customized. \n\nThe `IconContainer` component is a container for the icon that appears in the alert message. It has a fixed width and height of 24px and is a flex container with its child elements centered both horizontally and vertically. The SVG icon is set to display block and has a width of 100% and height of auto. \n\nThese components are used to create alert messages throughout the Alephium web3 project. For example, an alert message could be created with the following code:\n\n```\nimport { AlertContainer, IconContainer } from 'alephium-web3'\n\nconst MyAlert = () => {\n  return (\n    <AlertContainer>\n      <IconContainer>\n        <svg>...</svg>\n      </IconContainer>\n      <div>Alert message goes here</div>\n    </AlertContainer>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThis would create an alert message with an icon and the text \"Alert message goes here\" inside the `AlertContainer`. The appearance of the alert message can be customized using CSS variables.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and where is it used in the project?\n- This code defines styled components for an alert container and an icon container, which are likely used for displaying alerts or notifications in the UI.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `motion` import from `framer-motion`?\n- The `motion` import is likely used to add animation and motion effects to the alert and icon containers.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `defaultTheme` import and how is it used in the code?\n- The `defaultTheme` import is used to set a maximum width for the alert container and to adjust its padding and font size for smaller screens. It is likely a set of default styling values for the project."
