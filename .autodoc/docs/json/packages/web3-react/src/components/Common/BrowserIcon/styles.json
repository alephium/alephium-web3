  "summary": "This code defines a styled component called `BrowserIconContainer` using the `styled-components` library. The component is a `motion.div` element that displays an SVG icon in the center of the container. The `motion` object is imported from the `framer-motion` library, which provides animation capabilities to React components. \n\nThe `BrowserIconContainer` component is designed to be used in a larger project that requires a browser icon. By importing this component, developers can easily add a browser icon to their application without having to write the CSS styling themselves. The component is responsive and will adjust its size to fit the available space. \n\nHere is an example of how the `BrowserIconContainer` component can be used in a React component:\n\n```\nimport { BrowserIconContainer } from 'alephium-web3'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>\n      <BrowserIconContainer>\n        <svg viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n          <path d=\"M12 2C6.5 2 2 6.5 2 12s4.5 10 10 10 10-4.5 10-10S17.5 2 12 2zm0 18c-4.4 0-8-3.6-8-8s3.6-8 8-8 8 3.6 8 8-3.6 8-8 8z\"/>\n        </svg>\n      </BrowserIconContainer>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `BrowserIconContainer` component is used to display a browser icon in the center of the page. The SVG code for the icon is passed as a child element to the `BrowserIconContainer` component. \n\nOverall, this code provides a reusable and responsive styled component for displaying a browser icon in a React application.",
