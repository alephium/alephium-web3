      "summary": "This code exports a React component called `FitText`. The purpose of this component is to automatically adjust the font size of its child elements to fit within the available space. This is useful for cases where the size of the text may vary depending on the user's device or screen size.\n\nThe `FitText` component uses the `useFitText` hook from the `../../../hooks/useFitText` module to calculate the appropriate font size. This hook takes several options, including `maxFontSize` and `minFontSize`, which specify the maximum and minimum font sizes that the component can use. The `onStart` and `onFinish` options are callbacks that are called when the font size calculation starts and finishes, respectively.\n\nThe `FitText` component renders a `div` element that wraps its child elements. The `ref` of this `div` element is set to the `textRef` variable returned by the `useFitText` hook. This allows the hook to measure the size of the text and calculate the appropriate font size. The `visibility` style of the `div` element is set to `hidden` until the font size calculation is complete, to avoid a flash of unstyled text.\n\nThe calculated font size is applied to the `fontSize` style of the `div` element. The `maxHeight` and `maxWidth` styles are set to `100%` to ensure that the text fits within the available space. The `display`, `justifyContent`, and `alignItems` styles are set to `flex`, `center`, and `center`, respectively, to center the text horizontally and vertically within the `div` element.\n\nThe `FitText` component is exported as a `default` export, and its `displayName` property is set to `'FitText'`. This allows the component to be imported and used in other parts of the project like any other React component. For example:\n\n```jsx\nimport FitText from 'alephium-web3/components/FitText'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <FitText>\n        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>\n      </FitText>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used within the Alephium project?\n- This code defines a React component called `FitText` that resizes its content to fit within a container. It is likely used within the Alephium project to display text that needs to fit within a specific space.\n\n2. What is the `useFitText` hook and what options can be passed to it?\n- The `useFitText` hook is used to calculate the optimal font size for the text content based on the size of the container. It accepts options such as `maxFontSize`, `minFontSize`, `onStart`, and `onFinish` to customize its behavior.\n\n3. Why does the `visibility` style property of the `div` element depend on the `ready` state?\n- The `visibility` property is set to `'hidden'` initially to avoid a flash of unstyled text before the font size is calculated. Once the font size is ready, the `visibility` property is set to `'visible'` to display the content."
