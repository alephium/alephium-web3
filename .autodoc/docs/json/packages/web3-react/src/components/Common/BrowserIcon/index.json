  "summary": "This code defines a React component called `BrowserIcon` that renders an icon for a web browser. The component takes a `browser` prop that specifies which browser to render an icon for. If the `browser` prop is not provided, the component will attempt to detect the current browser using the `detectBrowser` utility function from the `utils` module.\n\nThe `detectBrowser` function is not defined in this file, but it is likely a utility function that uses the `window.navigator.userAgent` property to determine the current browser. The `detectBrowser` function is imported from the `utils` module, which suggests that this component is part of a larger web application.\n\nThe `browsers` object is imported from the `assets/browsers` module, which contains SVG icons for each supported browser. The `BrowserIcon` component uses a `switch` statement to select the appropriate icon based on the `currentBrowser` value. If the `currentBrowser` value is not one of the supported browsers, the component returns an empty fragment.\n\nThe `BrowserIcon` component is a functional component that uses the `React.forwardRef` function to forward a ref to the underlying DOM element. The component renders the selected icon inside a `BrowserIconContainer` component, which is defined in the `styles` module.\n\nThe `BrowserIcon` component is exported as the default export of the module, which means that it can be imported and used in other modules. The `displayName` property is set to `'BrowserIcon'`, which is used by React for debugging purposes.\n\nOverall, this code defines a reusable React component that renders an icon for a web browser based on the `browser` prop or the current browser detected by the `detectBrowser` utility function. The component is likely used in a larger web application to provide browser-specific functionality or styling.",
