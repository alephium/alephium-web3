  "summary": "This code defines a React component called `Alert` that can be used to display alerts on a web page. The component takes two props: `children` and `icon`. The `children` prop is used to pass in the content of the alert, while the `icon` prop is used to pass in an optional icon to be displayed alongside the content.\n\nThe `Alert` component is defined using the `React.forwardRef` function, which allows the component to forward a ref to one of its children. This is useful when the component needs to access the DOM node of one of its children, for example to set focus or measure its size.\n\nThe `Alert` component renders a container element with the class `AlertContainer`, which is defined in a separate file. If the `icon` prop is provided, the component also renders an `IconContainer` element with the `icon` prop as its child. Finally, the component renders a `div` element with the `children` prop as its content.\n\nThe `Alert` component is exported as the default export of the module, which means that it can be imported and used in other parts of the project. For example, a parent component could use the `Alert` component to display an error message to the user:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport Alert from 'alephium-web3/Alert'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [error, setError] = React.useState(null)\n\n  function handleButtonClick() {\n    try {\n      // some code that might throw an error\n    } catch (error) {\n      setError(error.message)\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Do something risky</button>\n      {error && <Alert>{error}</Alert>}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MyComponent` function defines a state variable `error` that is initially set to `null`. When the user clicks the button, the component tries to execute some code that might throw an error. If an error is thrown, the component catches it and sets the `error` state variable to the error message. Finally, the component renders an `Alert` component with the `error` message as its content, which is displayed to the user.",
