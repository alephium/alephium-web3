  "summary": "This code defines a React component called `Tooltip` that renders a tooltip window with a message when the user hovers over or clicks on a target element. The tooltip is positioned relative to the target element and can be customized with an offset and a delay. The component uses the `useAlephiumConnectContext` hook to access the current route, theme, and mode of the Alephium Connect app.\n\nThe `Tooltip` component uses several React hooks to manage its state and layout. The `useState` hook is used to manage the `isOpen` state of the tooltip window, which is initially set to `false`. The `useMeasure` hook is used to measure the size and position of the target element and the tooltip window. The `useLayoutEffect` hook is used to update the layout of the tooltip window when the target element or the `isOpen` state changes. The `useEffect` hook is used to update the `isOpen` state when the `open` prop or the `context.open` state changes.\n\nThe `Tooltip` component uses the `motion` component from the `framer-motion` library to animate the opening and closing of the tooltip window. The `Portal` component is used to render the tooltip window outside the current React tree, which allows it to be positioned relative to the target element even if the target element is inside a container with a `overflow: hidden` style.\n\nThe `Tooltip` component exports a default function that takes several props:\n\n- `children`: the target element that triggers the tooltip window\n- `message`: the message to display in the tooltip window\n- `open`: a boolean that controls the visibility of the tooltip window\n- `xOffset`: the horizontal offset of the tooltip window relative to the target element\n- `yOffset`: the vertical offset of the tooltip window relative to the target element\n- `delay`: the delay before the tooltip window opens, in seconds\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `Tooltip` component:\n\n```jsx\nimport Tooltip from 'alephium-web3/components/Tooltip'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <Tooltip message=\"Hello, world!\" xOffset={10} yOffset={-10}>\n      <button>Hover me</button>\n    </Tooltip>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThis will render a button that displays a tooltip window with the message \"Hello, world!\" when the user hovers over it. The tooltip window will be positioned 10 pixels to the right and 10 pixels above the button.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the Alephium project?\n- This code is a React component for rendering tooltips and is used in the Alephium project for displaying information to users when they hover over certain elements.\n\n2. What are the dependencies of this code and what do they do?\n- This code has dependencies on the `react`, `react-use-measure`, `framer-motion`, and `alephiumConnect` packages. `react` is the core library for building the UI, `react-use-measure` is used for measuring the size and position of elements, `framer-motion` is used for animating the tooltip, and `alephiumConnect` is a custom context used for managing the state of the Alephium wallet.\n\n3. What are the conditions under which the tooltip is displayed and how is it positioned?\n- The tooltip is displayed when the user hovers over the element or when the `open` prop is set to `true`. The tooltip is positioned relative to the element being hovered over, with an optional offset specified by the `xOffset` and `yOffset` props. The code also checks if the tooltip is out of bounds of the viewport and adjusts its position accordingly."
