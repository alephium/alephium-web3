  "summary": "The `Portal` component in the `alephium-web3` project is a React component that allows rendering of child components outside of the parent component's DOM hierarchy. This is useful when a component needs to be rendered at a specific location in the DOM, such as a modal or a tooltip.\n\nThe `Portal` component uses the `useEffect` hook to check if the specified selector exists in the DOM. If it does, the component is mounted to the existing element. If it does not exist, a new element is created and mounted to the body of the document. The `useState` hook is used to keep track of whether the component is mounted or not.\n\nThe `createPortal` function from the `react-dom` library is used to render the child components into the mounted element. This function takes two arguments: the child components to be rendered and the DOM element to render them into.\n\nThe `Portal` component takes two props: `selector` and `children`. The `selector` prop is used to specify the ID of the element to render the child components into. If no ID is specified, a default ID of `__ALEPHIUMCONNECT__` is used. The `children` prop is used to specify the child components to be rendered.\n\nHere is an example of how the `Portal` component can be used:\n\n```\nimport Portal from './Portal'\n\nconst App = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>My App</h1>\n      <Portal selector=\"#modal\">\n        <div>\n          <h2>Modal</h2>\n          <p>This is a modal.</p>\n        </div>\n      </Portal>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Portal` component is used to render a modal outside of the parent component's DOM hierarchy. The `selector` prop is set to `#modal`, which specifies that the child components should be rendered into an element with an ID of `modal`. If no such element exists, a new element with an ID of `modal` is created and mounted to the body of the document. The `children` prop specifies the child components to be rendered into the `modal` element.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the Alephium project?\n- This code defines a React component called `Portal` that creates a portal to render React components into a DOM element specified by a selector. It is used in the Alephium project to render certain components outside of the normal React component tree.\n\n2. What are the props that can be passed to the `Portal` component?\n- The `Portal` component accepts an object of props, which can include a `selector` string specifying the DOM element to render the portal into, and any other props that can be passed to a React component.\n\n3. What is the license for this code and what are the terms of use?\n- This code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later. This means that it is free software that can be redistributed and modified, but comes with no warranty and must be used in accordance with the terms of the license."
