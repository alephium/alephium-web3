      "summary": "This code defines a React component called `Alert` that can be used to display alerts on a web page. The component takes two props: `children` and `icon`. The `children` prop is used to pass in the content of the alert, while the `icon` prop is used to pass in an optional icon to be displayed alongside the content.\n\nThe `Alert` component is defined using the `React.forwardRef` function, which allows the component to forward a ref to one of its children. This is useful when the component needs to access the DOM node of one of its children, for example to set focus or measure its size.\n\nThe `Alert` component renders a container element with the class `AlertContainer`, which is defined in a separate file. If the `icon` prop is provided, the component also renders an `IconContainer` element with the `icon` prop as its child. Finally, the component renders a `div` element with the `children` prop as its content.\n\nThe `Alert` component is exported as the default export of the module, which means that it can be imported and used in other parts of the project. For example, a parent component could use the `Alert` component to display an error message to the user:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport Alert from 'alephium-web3/Alert'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [error, setError] = React.useState(null)\n\n  function handleButtonClick() {\n    try {\n      // some code that might throw an error\n    } catch (error) {\n      setError(error.message)\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Do something risky</button>\n      {error && <Alert>{error}</Alert>}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MyComponent` function defines a state variable `error` that is initially set to `null`. When the user clicks the button, the component tries to execute some code that might throw an error. If an error is thrown, the component catches it and sets the `error` state variable to the error message. Finally, the component renders an `Alert` component with the `error` message as its content, which is displayed to the user.",

      "summary": "This code defines two styled components, `AlertContainer` and `IconContainer`, which are used to create alert messages with icons in the Alephium web3 project. \n\nThe `AlertContainer` component is a container for the alert message and can be customized using CSS variables. It is a flex container with a gap of 8px between its child elements. It has a position of relative and a border radius of 9px. The `padding`, `text-align`, `font-size`, `line-height`, and `font-weight` properties are also set. The `max-width` is set to 260px and the `min-width` is set to 100%. The component also has CSS variables for `border-radius`, `color`, `background`, and `box-shadow` which can be customized. \n\nThe `IconContainer` component is a container for the icon that appears in the alert message. It has a fixed width and height of 24px and is a flex container with its child elements centered both horizontally and vertically. The SVG icon is set to display block and has a width of 100% and height of auto. \n\nThese components are used to create alert messages throughout the Alephium web3 project. For example, an alert message could be created with the following code:\n\n```\nimport { AlertContainer, IconContainer } from 'alephium-web3'\n\nconst MyAlert = () => {\n  return (\n    <AlertContainer>\n      <IconContainer>\n        <svg>...</svg>\n      </IconContainer>\n      <div>Alert message goes here</div>\n    </AlertContainer>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThis would create an alert message with an icon and the text \"Alert message goes here\" inside the `AlertContainer`. The appearance of the alert message can be customized using CSS variables.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and where is it used in the project?\n- This code defines styled components for an alert container and an icon container, which are likely used for displaying alerts or notifications in the UI.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `motion` import from `framer-motion`?\n- The `motion` import is likely used to add animation and motion effects to the alert and icon containers.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `defaultTheme` import and how is it used in the code?\n- The `defaultTheme` import is used to set a maximum width for the alert container and to adjust its padding and font size for smaller screens. It is likely a set of default styling values for the project."

      "summary": "This code defines a TypeScript type called `AlertProps` that is exported for use in other parts of the Alephium project. The `AlertProps` type is an object that can have two properties: `children` and `icon`. The `children` property is of type `React.ReactNode`, which means it can accept any valid React node as its value. The `icon` property is also of type `React.ReactNode`, which means it can accept any valid React node as its value.\n\nThis type is likely used in components that display alerts or notifications to the user. By defining this type, the Alephium project can ensure that any components that use alerts or notifications have consistent props and can be easily maintained and updated.\n\nHere is an example of how this type might be used in a React component:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { AlertProps } from 'alephium-web3';\n\nconst Alert: React.FC<AlertProps> = ({ children, icon }) => {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"alert\">\n      {icon && <div className=\"alert-icon\">{icon}</div>}\n      <div className=\"alert-content\">{children}</div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Alert;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Alert` component accepts `AlertProps` as its props and uses the `children` and `icon` properties to render an alert. The `icon` property is optional, so it only renders if it is provided. This component can be used throughout the Alephium project to display alerts and notifications with consistent props.",

What is the purpose of this file in the alephium-web3 project?\n- This file contains a type definition for AlertProps, which is likely used in other parts of the project to define the props for an alert component.\n\n2.

What is the expected format for the children and icon props in AlertProps?\n- The children prop should be a React node, and the icon prop should also be a React node."
