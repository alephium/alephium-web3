  "summary": "This file contains styled components for a tooltip window that can be used in the Alephium web3 project. The tooltip window is a UI element that displays additional information when the user hovers over a specific element on the page. \n\nThe `TooltipWindow` component is a fixed-position element that covers the entire viewport and has a high z-index to ensure it appears above all other elements on the page. It has `pointer-events: none` to allow mouse events to pass through to the underlying elements. \n\nThe `TooltipContainer` component is the actual tooltip that appears when the user hovers over an element. It is an absolutely positioned element that is centered on the hovered element and has a border, padding, and background color to distinguish it from the rest of the page. It also has a shadow and a tail that points to the hovered element. The size of the tooltip can be customized using the `$size` prop, which is of type `TooltipSizeProps`. \n\nThe `TooltipTail` component is the tail of the tooltip that points to the hovered element. It is an absolutely positioned element that is centered on the right edge of the tooltip and has a triangular shape. The size of the tail can also be customized using the `$size` prop. \n\nThese components are styled using CSS variables that are defined elsewhere in the project. The `styled` function is imported from the `styled-components` library, which allows for easy creation of reusable styled components. \n\nOverall, these components provide a customizable and visually appealing tooltip window that can be used throughout the Alephium web3 project to enhance the user experience. Here is an example of how the `TooltipContainer` component can be used:\n\n```\nimport { TooltipContainer } from 'alephium-web3'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button>Hover me</button>\n      <TooltipContainer $size=\"small\">\n        This is a tooltip!\n      </TooltipContainer>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
