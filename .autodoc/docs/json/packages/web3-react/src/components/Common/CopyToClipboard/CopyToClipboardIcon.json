  "summary": "This code defines a React component called `CopyToClipboardIcon` that renders an icon used for copying content to the clipboard. The component imports `styled-components` and `framer-motion` libraries to style the icon and add animation effects. \n\nThe `IconContainer` styled component defines the styles for the icon container. It uses `motion.div` from `framer-motion` to add animation effects to the container. The `IconContainer` component has a `$clipboard` prop that is used to determine whether the icon is in a \"copied\" state. If `$clipboard` is true, the icon is styled with a different color and animation effect. \n\nThe `CopyToClipboardIcon` component takes two optional props: `copied` and `small`. If `copied` is true, the icon is styled with the `$clipboard` prop set to true, indicating that the content has been copied to the clipboard. If `small` is true, the icon is rendered in a smaller size. \n\nThis component can be used in other components or pages of the Alephium Web3 project to provide a UI element for copying content to the clipboard. For example, it could be used in a form component to allow users to copy a generated password or API key to the clipboard. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport CopyToClipboardIcon from './path/to/CopyToClipboardIcon'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [copied, setCopied] = useState(false)\n\n  const handleCopy = () => {\n    // copy content to clipboard\n    setCopied(true)\n    setTimeout(() => setCopied(false), 2000) // reset copied state after 2 seconds\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleCopy}>\n        Copy to clipboard\n        <CopyToClipboardIcon copied={copied} />\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n``` \n\nIn this example, the `CopyToClipboardIcon` component is used inside a button element to provide a UI element for copying content to the clipboard. The `copied` prop is set to `true` when the content is successfully copied to the clipboard, triggering the animation effect.",
