  "summary": "This code defines a TypeScript interface called `ButtonProps` that describes the properties that can be passed to a React component representing a button. The `ButtonProps` interface includes optional properties for the button's `children` (the text or other content displayed on the button), `variant` (one of three possible styles for the button), `disabled` (whether the button is disabled), `icon` (an optional icon to display on the button), `iconPosition` (whether the icon should be displayed to the left or right of the button text), `roundedIcon` (whether the icon should be displayed with rounded corners), `waiting` (whether the button is in a \"waiting\" state), `arrow` (whether the button should display an arrow), `download` (whether the button should initiate a download), `href` (the URL to navigate to when the button is clicked), `style` (additional CSS styles to apply to the button), and `onClick` (a callback function to execute when the button is clicked).\n\nThis interface is intended to be used as a type for the props passed to a React component representing a button. By defining the `ButtonProps` interface, the component can ensure that it only receives valid props and can provide type checking and autocompletion for those props in development environments.\n\nHere is an example of how this interface might be used in a React component:\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { ButtonProps } from 'alephium-web3'\n\nconst Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ children, variant = 'primary', disabled = false, onClick }) => {\n  return (\n    <button className={`button ${variant}`} disabled={disabled} onClick={onClick}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Button\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Button` component is defined as a functional component that accepts a single argument of type `ButtonProps`. The component uses destructuring to extract the `children`, `variant`, `disabled`, and `onClick` props from the `ButtonProps` object. The component then renders a standard HTML `button` element with the appropriate class name, disabled state, and click handler based on the props passed to it. By using the `ButtonProps` interface to define the expected props for the `Button` component, the component can ensure that it only receives valid props and can provide type checking and autocompletion for those props in development environments.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file is a React component that defines the props for a button.\n\n2. What are the available variants for the button?\n- The available variants for the button are 'primary', 'secondary', and 'tertiary'.\n\n3. Can the button have an icon and if so, can it be positioned on either the left or right side?\n- Yes, the button can have an icon and it can be positioned on either the left or right side using the 'icon' and 'iconPosition' props."
