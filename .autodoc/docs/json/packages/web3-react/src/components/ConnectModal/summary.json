      "summary": "The `ConnectUsing` component is a React functional component that provides a way for users to connect to the Alephium network using various methods. It imports `AnimatePresence` and `motion` from the `framer-motion` library, which are used to animate the transition between different connection methods. It also imports `useState` from React, which is used to manage the state of the component.\n\nThe component takes a single prop, `connectorId`, which is a string that represents the ID of the connector to use for the connection. The `supportedConnectors` constant is imported from `./../../constants/supportedConnectors`, which is an array of objects that represent the different connectors that are supported by the Alephium network. The `connector` constant is set to the first object in the `supportedConnectors` array that has an `id` property that matches the `connectorId` prop.\n\nThe `hasExtensionInstalled` constant is set to the result of calling the `extensionIsInstalled` function on the `connector` object, if it exists. This function is used to check if the browser extension required for the connection method is installed.\n\nThe `useInjector` constant is set to a boolean value that determines whether to use the injector flow or the QR code flow for the connection. If the connector is not scannable or the extension is installed, the injector flow is used. If the connector ID is `desktopWallet`, the desktop wallet flow is used. Otherwise, the QR code flow is used.\n\nThe `status` state is set to the appropriate value based on the `useInjector` constant and the `connectorId` prop. If the injector flow is used, the `ConnectWithInjector` component is rendered. If the desktop wallet flow is used, the `ConnectWithDesktopWallet` component is rendered. Otherwise, the `ConnectWithWalletConnect` component is rendered.\n\nIf the `connector` constant is falsy, an `Alert` component is rendered with the message \"Connector not found\".\n\nThe `AnimatePresence` component is used to animate the transition between the QR code flow and the injector flow. If the injector flow is used, the `ConnectWithInjector` component is wrapped in a `motion.div` component that is animated using the `contentVariants` object.\n\nThe `ConnectUsing` component is used in other components throughout the Alephium Web3 project to provide a consistent way for users to connect to the Alephium network using different methods. For example, it is used in the `ConnectWalletModal` component to allow users to connect their wallets to the Alephium network.",

It also imports two custom hooks, `useAlephiumConnectContext` and `useConnect`, from the `alephiumConnect` and `hooks` directories, respectively.\n\nThe `useAlephiumConnectContext` hook provides access to the Alephium Connect context, which contains information about the user's wallet, such as the address group, key type, and network ID. The `useConnect` hook is used to initiate the connection to the desktop wallet. It takes an object with the address group, key type, and network ID as arguments.\n\nThe `ConnectWithDesktopWallet` component uses the `useState` hook to define a state variable called `error`, which is initially set to `undefined`. The `useEffect` hook is used to call the `connect` function from the `useConnect` hook when the component mounts. If an error occurs during the connection process, the `setError` function is called to update the `error` state variable with the error message.\n\nFinally, the component returns a `PageContent` component with a `Container` component inside. The `Container` component displays either the `error` message or the text \"Opening desktop wallet...\" depending on whether an error occurred during the connection process.\n\nThis component is likely used in a larger project that involves interacting with the Alephium blockchain.

It imports several other components and hooks from the `alephium-web3` project, including `useEffect`, `useAlephiumConnectContext`, `Modal`, `Connectors`, `ConnectUsing`, `Profile`, and `useAccount`.\n\nThe `ConnectModal` component takes three optional props: `mode`, `theme`, and `customTheme`. These props are used to set the mode and theme of the modal window, as well as any custom theme properties that may be passed in.\n\nThe `ConnectModal` component uses the `useAlephiumConnectContext` hook to get the current state of the Alephium network connection. It also uses the `useAccount` hook to get the current account information. Based on this information, the component sets the `closeable` prop to `true` and determines whether to show a back button in the modal window.\n\nThe `ConnectModal` component defines an array of `Page` objects that represent the different pages of the modal window. These pages include the `Connectors` page, the `Connect` page, and the `Profile` page. Each page is associated with an `id` and a `content` property that contains the JSX to render the page.\n\nThe `ConnectModal` component defines several `useEffect` hooks that are used to update the state of the Alephium network connection, the mode and theme of the modal window, and the custom theme properties. These hooks are called whenever the corresponding prop or state value changes.\n\nFinally, the `ConnectModal` component returns a `Modal` component that renders the modal window. The `Modal` component takes several props, including the `open` prop that determines whether the modal window is visible, the `pages` prop that contains the array of `Page` objects, the `pageId` prop that determines which page to show, the `onClose` prop that is called when the modal window is closed, the `onInfo` prop that is called when the info button is clicked, and the `onBack` prop that is called when the back button is clicked.\n\nOverall, the `ConnectModal` component provides a simple and flexible way to connect to the Alephium network and manage the connection state.

The component handles various connection states, such as connecting, connected, expiring, failed, rejected, not connected, and unavailable.\n\nThe component accepts three props: `connectorId`, `switchConnectMethod`, and `forceState`. The `connectorId` is used to identify the specific browser extension to connect with. The `switchConnectMethod` function is called when the user wants to switch to a different connection method, such as scanning a QR code. The optional `forceState` prop can be used to force the component into a specific state for testing purposes.\n\nThe component uses the `useAlephiumConnectContext` and `useConnect` hooks to manage the connection with the Alephium wallet. It also uses the `supportedConnectors` constant to filter the list of supported connectors based on the provided `connectorId`.\n\nThe component renders different content based on the current connection state. For example, when the state is `connecting`, it displays a spinner animation with the logo of the selected connector. If the state is `failed` or `rejected`, it shows an error message and a retry button. If the state is `unavailable`, it suggests installing the required browser extension.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `ConnectWithInjector` component:\n\n```jsx\n<ConnectWithInjector\n  connectorId=\"metamask\"\n  switchConnectMethod={switchConnectMethod}\n/>\n```\n\nThis will render the component with the MetaMask connector and handle the connection process accordingly.",

It manages various states like connecting, connected, expiring, failed, rejected, not connected, and unavailable, and updates the UI accordingly based on the current state.\n\n2. **Question:** How does the `runConnect` function work and when is it called?\n   **Answer:** The `runConnect` function is responsible for initiating the connection process with the wallet connector. It checks if the extension is installed and then calls the `connect` function from the `useConnect` hook. If the connection is successful, it updates the status to connected and closes the context. The function is called within a `useEffect` hook with a 600ms timeout to give the user time to see the UI before opening the extension.\n\n3. **Question:** How does the code handle the countdown timer for the expiring state?\n   **Answer:** The code has a commented-out section for handling the countdown timer for the expiring state. It initializes the `expiryTimer` state with a default value of 9 and uses a `useEffect` hook to update the timer. However, the timer functionality is currently not being used, and the countdown timer is not displayed in the UI."

It handles various connection states and renders different content based on the current state:\n\n```jsx\nimport ConnectWithInjector from 'alephium-web3/components/ConnectModal/ConnectWithInjector'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <ConnectWithInjector connectorId=\"metamask\" />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ConnectWithInjector` component is used with the MetaMask connector to handle the connection process.\n\nOverall, the components in the `ConnectModal` folder provide a simple and flexible way to connect to the Alephium network and manage the connection state. They can be used in conjunction with other components and hooks from the `alephium-web3` project to build more complex applications that interact with the Alephium network.",
