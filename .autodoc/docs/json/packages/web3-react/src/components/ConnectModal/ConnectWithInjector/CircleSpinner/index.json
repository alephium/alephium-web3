  "summary": "The `CircleSpinner` component is a React component that renders a circular spinner animation with an optional logo. It is used to indicate that a process is running or loading, such as when connecting to a server or fetching data. \n\nThe component takes in several props, including `logo`, `smallLogo`, `connecting`, `unavailable`, and `countdown`. The `logo` prop is used to pass in a custom logo to be displayed in the center of the spinner. The `smallLogo` prop is a boolean that determines whether the logo should be smaller. The `connecting` prop is a boolean that determines whether the spinner should be displayed. The `unavailable` prop is a boolean that determines whether the spinner should have a rounded border or not. The `countdown` prop is a boolean that determines whether the spinner should have a countdown animation.\n\nThe spinner animation is created using SVG and Framer Motion. The spinner consists of a circular path that is animated to rotate around the center of the spinner. The `AnimatePresence` component is used to animate the spinner in and out of the DOM. When the `connecting` prop is true, the spinner is displayed with a fade-in animation. When the `countdown` prop is true, the spinner is displayed with a countdown animation that fades out after a short duration.\n\nThe `CircleSpinner` component is used throughout the Alephium Web3 project to indicate loading or connecting states. It can be used in conjunction with other components to create a more complex loading or connecting UI. For example, it can be used in a modal or overlay to indicate that a process is running in the background. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport CircleSpinner from 'alephium-web3/components/CircleSpinner'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <CircleSpinner connecting />\n      <p>Loading...</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
