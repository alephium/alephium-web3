  "summary": "This file contains styled components for the Alephium web3 project. The purpose of this code is to define the styles for the logo and spinner components used in the project. \n\nThe LogoContainer component is a container for the logo and spinner components. It is a motion div with a fixed width and height, and a z-index of 4. The Logo component is a motion div that is positioned absolutely within the LogoContainer. It has a border-radius of 50px, a background color of var(--ck-body-background), and is centered within the LogoContainer. The SpinnerContainer component is also a motion div that is positioned absolutely within the LogoContainer. The ExpiringSpinner and Spinner components are both motion divs that are positioned absolutely within the SpinnerContainer. \n\nThe ExpiringSpinner component is a spinner that has two halves that rotate in opposite directions. It is positioned within the SpinnerContainer and has a background color of var(--ck-body-background). The Spinner component is a simple spinner that rotates continuously. It is also positioned within the SpinnerContainer. \n\nThese components can be used in the larger Alephium web3 project to display the logo and spinner animations. For example, the LogoContainer component can be used as a wrapper for the Logo and Spinner components in a loading screen or splash page. The Spinner component can be used to indicate that a process is in progress, while the ExpiringSpinner component can be used to indicate that a process is about to expire. \n\nOverall, this code provides a set of reusable styled components that can be used throughout the Alephium web3 project to create a consistent and visually appealing user interface.",
