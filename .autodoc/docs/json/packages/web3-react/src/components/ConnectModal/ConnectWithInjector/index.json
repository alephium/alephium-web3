  "summary": "The `ConnectWithInjector` component in the `alephium-web3` project is responsible for managing the connection between the Alephium wallet and supported browser extensions (also known as injectors). The component handles various connection states, such as connecting, connected, expiring, failed, rejected, not connected, and unavailable.\n\nThe component accepts three props: `connectorId`, `switchConnectMethod`, and `forceState`. The `connectorId` is used to identify the specific browser extension to connect with. The `switchConnectMethod` function is called when the user wants to switch to a different connection method, such as scanning a QR code. The optional `forceState` prop can be used to force the component into a specific state for testing purposes.\n\nThe component uses the `useAlephiumConnectContext` and `useConnect` hooks to manage the connection with the Alephium wallet. It also uses the `supportedConnectors` constant to filter the list of supported connectors based on the provided `connectorId`.\n\nThe component renders different content based on the current connection state. For example, when the state is `connecting`, it displays a spinner animation with the logo of the selected connector. If the state is `failed` or `rejected`, it shows an error message and a retry button. If the state is `unavailable`, it suggests installing the required browser extension.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `ConnectWithInjector` component:\n\n```jsx\n<ConnectWithInjector\n  connectorId=\"metamask\"\n  switchConnectMethod={switchConnectMethod}\n/>\n```\n\nThis will render the component with the MetaMask connector and handle the connection process accordingly.",
  "questions": "1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `ConnectWithInjector` component and how does it work with different connector states?\n   **Answer:** The `ConnectWithInjector` component is responsible for handling the connection process with different wallet connectors. It manages various states like connecting, connected, expiring, failed, rejected, not connected, and unavailable, and updates the UI accordingly based on the current state.\n\n2. **Question:** How does the `runConnect` function work and when is it called?\n   **Answer:** The `runConnect` function is responsible for initiating the connection process with the wallet connector. It checks if the extension is installed and then calls the `connect` function from the `useConnect` hook. If the connection is successful, it updates the status to connected and closes the context. The function is called within a `useEffect` hook with a 600ms timeout to give the user time to see the UI before opening the extension.\n\n3. **Question:** How does the code handle the countdown timer for the expiring state?\n   **Answer:** The code has a commented-out section for handling the countdown timer for the expiring state. It initializes the `expiryTimer` state with a default value of 9 and uses a `useEffect` hook to update the timer. However, the timer functionality is currently not being used, and the countdown timer is not displayed in the UI."
