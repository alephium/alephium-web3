  "summary": "This code defines a styled component called `TextContainer` using the `styled-components` library. The component is a `motion.div` element imported from the `framer-motion` library, which provides animation capabilities. The `TextContainer` component is designed to be used as a container for text elements, with properties that center and align the text within the container.\n\nThe `styled` function is used to create a styled component by passing in the `motion.div` element as an argument. The resulting `TextContainer` component has CSS properties applied to it, including `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `display`, `align-items`, `justify-content`, and `white-space`. These properties are used to position and style the text within the container.\n\nThe `TextContainer` component is exported as a named export, which means it can be imported and used in other files within the project. For example, if a developer wanted to create a text element that was centered and animated, they could import the `TextContainer` component and use it as a wrapper for their text element. Here is an example of how the `TextContainer` component could be used:\n\n```\nimport { TextContainer } from 'alephium-web3'\n\nconst MyText = () => {\n  return (\n    <TextContainer animate={{ scale: 1.2 }} transition={{ duration: 1 }}>\n      <h1>Hello World!</h1>\n    </TextContainer>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `TextContainer` component is used to wrap an `h1` element that says \"Hello World!\". The `animate` and `transition` props are passed to the `TextContainer` component to provide animation effects. When the component is rendered, the text will be centered within the container and will scale up by 20% over a duration of 1 second.\n\nOverall, this code provides a reusable component for text elements that need to be centered and animated within a container. It demonstrates the use of styled components and the `framer-motion` library to create dynamic and visually appealing user interfaces.",
