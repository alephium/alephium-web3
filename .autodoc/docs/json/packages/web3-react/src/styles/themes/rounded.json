  "summary": "This file contains a set of CSS variables that define the styling for various components in the Alephium web3 project. These variables are exported as an object with their names as keys and their values as values. \n\nThe purpose of this file is to provide a centralized location for defining the styling of components in the project. By using CSS variables, the styling can be easily modified and updated throughout the project by simply changing the value of the variable. This makes it easier to maintain a consistent look and feel across the project and to make changes to the styling without having to modify individual components.\n\nFor example, the variable `--ck-connectbutton-background` defines the background color of a connect button component. If the project's designers decide to change the background color of all connect buttons, they can simply update the value of this variable and the change will be reflected throughout the project.\n\nThis file is likely imported and used in other components throughout the project to apply the defined styles. For example, a connect button component might use the `--ck-connectbutton-background` variable to set its background color.\n\nOverall, this file serves as a central location for defining and managing the styling of components in the Alephium web3 project.",
