  "summary": "This code file is part of the Alephium-web3 project and contains a set of CSS custom properties (variables) that define the styling for various UI components. These variables are used to maintain a consistent look and feel across the application, making it easier to update the design in the future.\n\nThe variables are grouped into different categories, such as colors, backgrounds, box shadows, border radius, and more. For example, the `--ck-font-family` variable sets the font family for the entire application, while the `--ck-focus-color` variable defines the color for focused elements.\n\nSome variables are specific to certain UI components, like the primary and secondary buttons. The primary button styling is defined by variables like `--ck-primary-button-background`, `--ck-primary-button-box-shadow`, and `--ck-primary-button-border-radius`. Similarly, the secondary button styling is defined by variables like `--ck-secondary-button-color`, `--ck-secondary-button-border-radius`, and `--ck-secondary-button-box-shadow`.\n\nOther variables are related to modals, tooltips, dropdowns, and alerts. For instance, the `--ck-modal-box-shadow` variable sets the box shadow for modals, while the `--ck-tooltip-background` variable defines the background color for tooltips.\n\nHere's an example of how these variables can be used in a CSS file:\n\n```css\n.button-primary {\n  background: var(--ck-primary-button-background);\n  box-shadow: var(--ck-primary-button-box-shadow);\n  border-radius: var(--ck-primary-button-border-radius);\n}\n```\n\nBy using these custom properties, developers can easily apply consistent styling to various elements throughout the Alephium-web3 project, ensuring a cohesive user experience.",
