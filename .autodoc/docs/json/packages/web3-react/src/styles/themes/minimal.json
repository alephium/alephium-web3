  "summary": "This file contains a set of CSS variables that define the styling for various components in the Alephium web3 project. These variables are exported as an object with their names as keys and their values as the corresponding CSS property values. \n\nThe purpose of this file is to provide a centralized location for defining the styling of components in the project. By using CSS variables, the styling can be easily customized and updated throughout the project. For example, if the color scheme of the project needs to be changed, the values of the variables in this file can be updated, and the changes will be reflected throughout the project.\n\nThe variables in this file define the styling for various components such as buttons, dropdowns, modals, and tooltips. For example, the `--ck-primary-button-background` variable defines the background color of primary buttons, while the `--ck-dropdown-button-color` variable defines the color of dropdown buttons. \n\nDevelopers can use these variables in their CSS files to apply the defined styling to their components. For example, to apply the background color of primary buttons, a developer can use the following CSS rule:\n\n```\nbutton.primary {\n  background-color: var(--ck-primary-button-background);\n}\n```\n\nOverall, this file plays an important role in defining the visual style of the Alephium web3 project and provides a convenient way for developers to apply and customize the styling of components.",
