      "summary": "This code exports an object that contains CSS variables for a light and dark theme. These variables are used to style the UI of the Alephium Web3 project. \n\nThe light theme contains variables for styling buttons, modals, tooltips, and the network dropdown. The `--ck-connectbutton` variables are used to style the \"Connect Wallet\" button, which is a prominent feature of the UI. The `--ck-primary-button` and `--ck-secondary-button` variables are used to style primary and secondary buttons respectively. The `--ck-modal` variables are used to style the modal component, which is used to display important information to the user. The `--ck-tooltip` variables are used to style tooltips, which provide additional information when the user hovers over certain elements. The `--ck-dropdown-button` variables are used to style the network dropdown, which allows the user to switch between different networks.\n\nThe dark theme contains similar variables to the light theme, but with different color values to create a dark UI. The `--ck-connectbutton` variables are used to style the \"Connect Wallet\" button, which is still a prominent feature of the UI. The `--ck-primary-button` and `--ck-secondary-button` variables are used to style primary and secondary buttons respectively. The `--ck-modal` variables are used to style the modal component, which is used to display important information to the user. The `--ck-tooltip` variables are used to style tooltips, which provide additional information when the user hovers over certain elements. The `--ck-dropdown-button` variables are used to style the network dropdown, which allows the user to switch between different networks.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to easily customize the styling of the Alephium Web3 project based on a light or dark theme. Developers can use these variables to create a consistent and visually appealing UI for their users. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```html\n<!-- Connect Wallet button -->\n<button class=\"connect-wallet-button\">Connect Wallet</button>\n\n<!-- Primary button -->\n<button class=\"primary-button\">Submit</button>\n\n<!-- Modal -->\n<div class=\"modal\">\n  <div class=\"modal-content\">\n    <h2>Important Information</h2>\n    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>\n    <button class=\"close-modal-button\">Close</button>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Tooltip -->\n<div class=\"tooltip\">\n  <span class=\"tooltip-text\">Tooltip text</span>\n  <span class=\"tooltip-icon\">?</span>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Network dropdown -->\n<div class=\"network-dropdown\">\n  <button class=\"dropdown-button\">Mainnet</button>\n  <div class=\"dropdown-content\">\n    <a href=\"#\">Testnet</a>\n    <a href=\"#\">Rinkeby</a>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code exports a default object containing CSS variables for styling a web3 interface in both light and dark modes.\n\n2.

The themes are defined in separate files and imported into this file using ES6 module syntax. The exported object contains properties for each theme, with the property name being the name of the theme and the value being an object containing the theme's styles.\n\nThis code is important for the larger project because it allows users of the Alephium web3 interface library to easily switch between different visual themes for the interface. By importing the desired theme from this file and passing it to the appropriate component in the library, users can customize the look and feel of the interface to their liking.\n\nFor example, if a user wants to use the \"web95\" theme, they can import it from this file like so:\n\n```\nimport { web95 } from 'alephium-web3/themes'\n```\n\nAnd then pass it to the appropriate component in the library like so:\n\n```\n<SomeComponent theme={web95} />\n```\n\nThis will apply the \"web95\" theme styles to the component, giving it a distinct visual appearance.\n\nOverall, this code is a simple but important part of the Alephium web3 interface library, allowing users to customize the look and feel of the interface to their liking.",
