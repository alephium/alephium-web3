  "summary": "This file contains a set of CSS variables that define the styling for various components in the Alephium web3 project. These variables are exported as an object with their names as keys and their values as values. \n\nThe purpose of this file is to provide a centralized location for defining the styling of the project's components. By using CSS variables, the styling can be easily changed and updated throughout the project by simply modifying the values of these variables. \n\nFor example, the `--ck-connectbutton-background` variable defines the background color of a connect button component. If the project's designers decide to change the background color of all connect buttons, they can simply update the value of this variable and the change will be reflected throughout the project. \n\nSimilarly, the `--ck-primary-button-color` variable defines the text color of a primary button component. If the designers decide to change the text color of all primary buttons, they can update the value of this variable and the change will be reflected throughout the project. \n\nOverall, this file plays an important role in maintaining consistency and flexibility in the styling of the Alephium web3 project.",
