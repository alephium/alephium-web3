  "summary": "This code exports a set of CSS variables that define the styling for various UI elements in the Alephium web3 project. These variables can be used throughout the project to ensure consistent styling across different components.\n\nThe variables are organized by element type, such as buttons, tooltips, and dropdowns. Each variable defines a specific aspect of the element's appearance, such as its background color, font size, or box shadow.\n\nFor example, the `--ck-connectbutton-background` variable defines the background color for the \"connect\" button, while `--ck-body-color-muted` defines a muted text color for the body of the page.\n\nDevelopers working on the Alephium web3 project can use these variables in their CSS code to ensure that their components match the overall design of the project. For example, a developer might use the `--ck-primary-button-background` variable to set the background color of a button in their component:\n\n```\n.my-button {\n  background-color: var(--ck-primary-button-background);\n  /* other styles */\n}\n```\n\nBy using the CSS variables defined in this file, developers can ensure that their components are consistent with the rest of the project and avoid duplicating styles or introducing inconsistencies.\n\nOverall, this file plays an important role in defining the visual style of the Alephium web3 project and ensuring that it is consistent across different components.",
