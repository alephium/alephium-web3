The `children` prop is used to pass in the content of the alert, while the `icon` prop is used to pass in an optional icon to be displayed alongside the content.\n\nThe `Alert` component is defined using the `React.forwardRef` function, which allows the component to forward a ref to one of its children. This is useful when the component needs to access the DOM node of one of its children, for example to set focus or measure its size.\n\nThe `Alert` component renders a container element with the class `AlertContainer`, which is defined in a separate file. If the `icon` prop is provided, the component also renders an `IconContainer` element with the `icon` prop as its child. Finally, the component renders a `div` element with the `children` prop as its content.\n\nThe `Alert` component is exported as the default export of the module, which means that it can be imported and used in other parts of the project. For example, a parent component could use the `Alert` component to display an error message to the user:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport Alert from 'alephium-web3/Alert'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [error, setError] = React.useState(null)\n\n  function handleButtonClick() {\n    try {\n      // some code that might throw an error\n    } catch (error) {\n      setError(error.message)\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Do something risky</button>\n      {error && <Alert>{error}</Alert>}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MyComponent` function defines a state variable `error` that is initially set to `null`. When the user clicks the button, the component tries to execute some code that might throw an error. If an error is thrown, the component catches it and sets the `error` state variable to the error message.

This type is used in components that display alerts or notifications to the user, ensuring consistent props and easy maintenance and updates.\n\nHere's an example of how the `Alert` component can be used in a parent component:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport Alert from 'alephium-web3/Alert'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [error, setError] = React.useState(null)\n\n  function handleButtonClick() {\n    try {\n      // some code that might throw an error\n    } catch (error) {\n      setError(error.message)\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Do something risky</button>\n      {error && <Alert>{error}</Alert>}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MyComponent` function defines a state variable `error` that is initially set to `null`. When the user clicks the button, the component tries to execute some code that might throw an error. If an error is thrown, the component catches it and sets the `error` state variable to the error message. Finally, the component renders an `Alert` component with the `error` message as its content, which is displayed to the user.",

The `detectBrowser` function is imported from the `utils` module, which suggests that this component is part of a larger web application.\n\nThe `browsers` object is imported from the `assets/browsers` module, which contains SVG icons for each supported browser. The `BrowserIcon` component uses a `switch` statement to select the appropriate icon based on the `currentBrowser` value. If the `currentBrowser` value is not one of the supported browsers, the component returns an empty fragment.\n\nThe `BrowserIcon` component is a functional component that uses the `React.forwardRef` function to forward a ref to the underlying DOM element. The component renders the selected icon inside a `BrowserIconContainer` component, which is defined in the `styles` module.\n\nThe `BrowserIcon` component is exported as the default export of the module, which means that it can be imported and used in other modules.

The `Container` and `OffsetContainer` components define the styles for the copy icon and the string, respectively. The `Button` component is imported from another file and is used to create the button variant of the `CopyToClipboard` component.\n\nThe `CopyToClipboard` component takes three props: `string`, `children`, and `variant`. The `string` prop is the string that will be copied to the clipboard when the user clicks the copy icon or button. The `children` prop is the content that will be displayed alongside the copy icon or button. The `variant` prop determines whether the component should be rendered as a standalone component or a button.\n\nWhen the user clicks the copy icon or button, the `onCopy` function is called. This function first checks if a string has been provided. If not, it returns early. If a string has been provided, it is trimmed and then copied to the clipboard using the `navigator.clipboard.writeText` method if available.

It can be used in various contexts, such as copying a URL, a code snippet, or any other text content. The component can be rendered either as a standalone icon or as a button with the icon.\n\nThe `CopyToClipboardIcon.tsx` file defines a `CopyToClipboardIcon` component that renders an icon for copying content to the clipboard. It uses the `styled-components` and `framer-motion` libraries to style the icon and add animation effects. The component takes two optional props: `copied` and `small`. If `copied` is true, the icon is styled with the `$clipboard` prop set to true, indicating that the content has been copied to the clipboard. If `small` is true, the icon is rendered in a smaller size.\n\nThe `index.tsx` file defines a `CopyToClipboard` component that provides a way to copy a given string to the clipboard. The component takes three props: `string`, `children`, and `variant`. The `string` prop is the string that will be copied to the clipboard when the user clicks the copy icon or button. The `children` prop is the content that will be displayed alongside the copy icon or button. The `variant` prop determines whether the component should be rendered as a standalone component or a button.\n\nHere's an example of how the `CopyToClipboard` component can be used:\n\n```jsx\nimport CopyToClipboard from './path/to/CopyToClipboard'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <CopyToClipboard string=\"https://example.com\" variant=\"button\">\n        Copy URL\n      </CopyToClipboard>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `CopyToClipboard` component is used to create a button that copies the given URL to the clipboard when clicked. The `variant` prop is set to `\"button\"` to render the component as a button, and the `children` prop is used to display the text \"Copy URL\" alongside the copy icon.\n\nOverall, the `CopyToClipboard` component and its related files provide a flexible and reusable way to add clipboard functionality to the `alephium-web3` project.",

The purpose of this component is to automatically adjust the font size of its child elements to fit within the available space. This is useful for cases where the size of the text may vary depending on the user's device or screen size.\n\nThe `FitText` component uses the `useFitText` hook from the `../../../hooks/useFitText` module to calculate the appropriate font size. This hook takes several options, including `maxFontSize` and `minFontSize`, which specify the maximum and minimum font sizes that the component can use. The `onStart` and `onFinish` options are callbacks that are called when the font size calculation starts and finishes, respectively.\n\nThe `FitText` component renders a `div` element that wraps its child elements. The `ref` of this `div` element is set to the `textRef` variable returned by the `useFitText` hook. This allows the hook to measure the size of the text and calculate the appropriate font size. The `visibility` style of the `div` element is set to `hidden` until the font size calculation is complete, to avoid a flash of unstyled text.\n\nThe calculated font size is applied to the `fontSize` style of the `div` element.

These props control the modal's visibility, content, positioning, and event handlers for closing, going back, and showing more information.\n\nThe `Page` component is used to render each page within the modal, and it handles the transition states and animations for entering and exiting the page. The `OrDivider` component is a simple styled divider with a customizable text, typically used to separate different sections or actions within the modal.\n\nThe `Modal` component uses the `AnimatePresence` and `motion` components from the `framer-motion` library to handle animations and transitions. It also uses custom hooks like `useTransition`, `useFocusTrap`, and `usePrevious` to manage the modal's state, focus management, and previous values.\n\nHere's an example of how the `Modal` component can be used:\n\n```jsx\nimport Modal, { routes, OrDivider } from './Modal';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const [modalOpen, setModalOpen] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleModalClose = () => {\n    setModalOpen(false);\n  };\n\n  const pages = [\n    {\n      id: routes.CONNECTORS,\n      content: <div>Connectors Content</div>,\n    },\n    {\n      id: routes.PROFILE,\n      content: <div>Profile Content</div>,\n    },\n  ];\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => setModalOpen(true)}>Open Modal</button>\n      <Modal\n        open={modalOpen}\n        pages={pages}\n        pageId={routes.CONNECTORS}\n        onClose={handleModalClose}\n      />\n    </>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, a button is used to open the modal, and the `handleModalClose` function is passed as the `onClose` prop to close the modal.

The `ThemeContainer` component is also exported, but it is not used in this file.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to render customizable buttons with different color schemes and animations. For example, it could be used in a web application to render a primary button with a blue color scheme and a secondary button with a gray color scheme. The `autoSize` prop could be set to `false` for buttons with fixed widths, and the `duration` prop could be adjusted to change the animation speed. Overall, this component provides a flexible and reusable way to render buttons with different styles and behaviors. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport ThemedButton from './ThemedButton'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <ThemedButton variant=\"primary\" onClick={() => console.log('Clicked!')}>\n        Click me!\n      </ThemedButton>\n      <ThemedButton variant=\"secondary\" autoSize={false}>\n        Fixed width button\n      </ThemedButton>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",

It sets the display to flex, aligns items to the center, and justifies content to the start. It also sets the position to relative, height to 40px, padding to 0, line-height to 0, letter-spacing to -0.2px, font-size to 16px, and font-weight to 500. It also sets the text-align to center and applies a transition effect to color, background, box-shadow, and border-radius. \n\nThe `Container` component has two variants, `primary` and `secondary`. The `primary` variant sets the `--color`, `--background`, `--box-shadow`, and `--border-radius` CSS variables to specific values. It also sets the `--hover-color`, `--hover-background`, `--hover-box-shadow`, and `--hover-border-radius` CSS variables to specific values for when the button is hovered over. Similarly, it sets the `--active-color`, `--active-background`, `--active-box-shadow`, and `--active-border-radius` CSS variables to specific values for when the button is clicked. \n\nThe `secondary` variant is similar to the `primary` variant, but it sets different CSS variables for the button's color, background, box-shadow, and border-radius. \n\nThe `ThemeContainer` component is a styled button that sets all CSS properties to initial values and sets the appearance to none. It also sets the user-select to none, position to relative, padding to 0, margin to 0, and background to none. It sets the border-radius to a CSS variable `--ck-border-radius`. \n\nThe `ThemeContainer` component has a `disabled` state that sets the pointer-events to none and opacity to 0.3. \n\nThe `ThemeContainer` component also has a hover state that changes the color, background, box-shadow, and border-radius of the `Container` component when the button is hovered over. Similarly, it has an active state that changes these properties when the button is clicked. \n\nThese styled components can be used to create buttons with different styles throughout the Alephium Web3 project.

The component uses the `useAlephiumConnectContext` hook to access the current route, theme, and mode of the Alephium Connect app.\n\nThe `Tooltip` component uses several React hooks to manage its state and layout. The `useState` hook is used to manage the `isOpen` state of the tooltip window, which is initially set to `false`. The `useMeasure` hook is used to measure the size and position of the target element and the tooltip window. The `useLayoutEffect` hook is used to update the layout of the tooltip window when the target element or the `isOpen` state changes. The `useEffect` hook is used to update the `isOpen` state when the `open` prop or the `context.open` state changes.\n\nThe `Tooltip` component uses the `motion` component from the `framer-motion` library to animate the opening and closing of the tooltip window. The `Portal` component is used to render the tooltip window outside the current React tree, which allows it to be positioned relative to the target element even if the target element is inside a container with a `overflow: hidden` style.\n\nThe `Tooltip` component exports a default function that takes several props:\n\n- `children`: the target element that triggers the tooltip window\n- `message`: the message to display in the tooltip window\n- `open`: a boolean that controls the visibility of the tooltip window\n- `xOffset`: the horizontal offset of the tooltip window relative to the target element\n- `yOffset`: the vertical offset of the tooltip window relative to the target element\n- `delay`: the delay before the tooltip window opens, in seconds\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `Tooltip` component:\n\n```jsx\nimport Tooltip from 'alephium-web3/components/Tooltip'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <Tooltip message=\"Hello, world!\" xOffset={10} yOffset={-10}>\n      <button>Hover me</button>\n    </Tooltip>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThis will render a button that displays a tooltip window with the message \"Hello, world!\" when the user hovers over it.

When the component is rendered, the text will be centered within the container and will scale up by 20% over a duration of 1 second.\n\nOverall, this code provides a reusable component for text elements that need to be centered and animated within a container. It demonstrates the use of styled components and the `framer-motion` library to create dynamic and visually appealing user interfaces.",

The main component, `AlephiumConnectButton`, renders a button that opens a modal for wallet connection or profile viewing. It takes several optional props, such as a label, an `onClick` function, and a `displayAccount` function.\n\nFor example, to use the `AlephiumConnectButton` in a web application, you would import it and include it in your JSX:\n\n```javascript\nimport { AlephiumConnectButton } from 'alephium-web3';\n\nconst MyApp = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to MyApp</h1>\n      <AlephiumConnectButton />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nThe `ConnectButtonRenderer` component is a helper component that renders the content of the modal. It takes a `displayAccount` prop to display the user's account information in the modal. This component can be used externally if a custom modal is desired.\n\nThe `useAlephiumConnectContext` hook provides access to the Alephium Connect context, which contains information about the user's wallet connection status and theme. The `useAccount` hook is used to access the user's account information, including their address.\n\nThe `styles.ts` file defines a styled component called `TextContainer` using the `styled-components` library. This component is a `motion.div` element imported from the `framer-motion` library, which provides animation capabilities.

The `connectorId` is used to identify the specific browser extension to connect with. The `switchConnectMethod` function is called when the user wants to switch to a different connection method, such as scanning a QR code. The optional `forceState` prop can be used to force the component into a specific state for testing purposes.\n\nThe component uses the `useAlephiumConnectContext` and `useConnect` hooks to manage the connection with the Alephium wallet.

Each button includes a label and an icon, and when clicked, initiates a connection to the corresponding network.\n\nThe `Profile` folder in the Alephium web3 project contains code related to displaying the user's account information and balance, as well as providing a way to disconnect from the Alephium network. The folder consists of two files: `index.tsx` and `styles.ts`.\n\n`index.tsx` defines a React functional component called `Profile` that displays the user's account information and balance. It imports several hooks and components from other files in the project, including `useAlephiumConnectContext`, `useAccount`, `useBalance`, `AnimatePresence`, `prettifyAttoAlphAmount`, and `useConnect`. The `Profile` component retrieves the user's account and balance using the `useAccount` and `useBalance` hooks and renders the account address and balance in a modal dialog using the `ModalContent`, `ModalH1`, and `ModalBody` components. The balance is displayed using the `Balance` and `LoadingBalance` components, which use the `AnimatePresence` component to animate the transition between the two states. The `prettifyAttoAlphAmount` function is used to format the balance value. The component also renders a \"Disconnect\" button that calls the `useConnect` hook to disconnect the user from the Alephium network.\n\n`styles.ts` contains code related to the balance display of the Alephium web application. It exports three styled components: `BalanceContainer`, `Balance`, and `LoadingBalance`. `BalanceContainer` is a styled component that wraps around the `Balance` component and is used to position the balance display on the web page. `Balance` is a styled component that displays the balance of the user's account, while `LoadingBalance` is a styled component that displays a loading animation while the balance is being fetched from the server. The `PlaceholderKeyframes` constant is a keyframe animation that is used to animate the loading animation in `LoadingBalance`.\n\nHere's an example of how these components might be used in the larger Alephium web application:\n\n```javascript\nimport { BalanceContainer, Balance, LoadingBalance } from 'alephium-web3'\n\nfunction AccountBalance() {\n  const [balance, setBalance] = useState(null)\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetchBalance()\n  }, [])\n\n  async function fetchBalance() {\n    const balance = await fetch('/api/balance')\n    setBalance(balance)\n    setLoading(false)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <BalanceContainer>\n      {loading ? (\n        <LoadingBalance />\n      ) : (\n        <Balance>{balance}</Balance>\n      )}\n    </BalanceContainer>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `AccountBalance` component fetches the user's balance from the server and displays it using the `Balance` component. While the balance is being fetched, the `LoadingBalance` component is displayed instead. The `BalanceContainer` component is used to position the balance display on the web page.",

          "summary": "The `useFitText` function is a custom React hook that resizes text to fit within a container. It is imported from the `alephium-web3` project and uses the `useCallback`, `useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect`, `useRef`, and `useState` hooks from the React library. The function takes an options object as an argument, which can include the following properties:\n\n- `logLevel`: A string that specifies the level of logging to use. The default value is `'info'`.\n- `maxFontSize`: A number that specifies the maximum font size to use. The default value is `100`.\n- `minFontSize`: A number that specifies the minimum font size to use. The default value is `20`.\n- `onFinish`: A function that is called when the font size has been adjusted to fit the text.\n- `onStart`: A function that is called when the font size adjustment process starts.\n- `resolution`: A number that specifies the resolution of the font size adjustment. The default value is `5`.\n\nThe function returns an object that contains the `fontSize` and `ref` properties. The `fontSize` property is a number that represents the font size that was used to fit the text. The `ref` property is a reference to the container element that the text is contained within.\n\nThe `useFitText` function uses a `ResizeObserver` to monitor changes to the size of the container element. When the size changes, the function recalculates the font size to fit the text. The function uses a binary search algorithm to adjust the font size until the text fits within the container. The `useIsoLayoutEffect` hook is used to suppress warnings when rendering on the server.\n\nThe `useFitText` function can be used in a larger project to dynamically adjust the font size of text to fit within a container. This can be useful for responsive design, where the size of the container may change depending on the size of the screen or the device being used. An example of how to use the `useFitText` function is shown below:\n\n```jsx\nimport useFitText from 'alephium-web3'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const { fontSize, ref } = useFitText()\n\n  return (\n    <div ref={ref}>\n      <p style={{ fontSize: `${fontSize}px` }}>This text will be resized to fit within the container.</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",

What are the parameters that can be passed to `useFitText`?\n- The `useFitText` hook accepts an options object with the following optional properties: `logLevel`, `maxFontSize`, `minFontSize`, `onFinish`, `onStart`, and `resolution`.\n\n3. How does `useFitText` determine the appropriate font size for the text?\n- `useFitText` uses a binary search algorithm to adjust the font size based on whether the text overflows the container or not. It also has a `resolution` option to determine how close the font size needs to be to the ideal size before stopping the search."

          "summary": "This code defines a React component called `FocusTrap` that can be used to trap focus within a specific element. The purpose of this component is to ensure that when a user interacts with a specific part of a web page, such as a modal dialog or a dropdown menu, they cannot accidentally tab out of that element and move focus to another part of the page. This can be especially important for users who rely on keyboard navigation to interact with web content.\n\nThe `FocusTrap` component uses a custom hook called `useFocusTrap` to manage focus trapping behavior. The `useFocusTrap` hook takes no arguments and returns a `ref` object that can be attached to a DOM element. When the `FocusTrap` component is mounted, it calls the `useFocusTrap` hook to get a `ref` to the element it should trap focus within. It then attaches an event listener to that element that listens for the `Tab` key. When the `Tab` key is pressed, the event listener checks whether the currently focused element is the first or last focusable element within the trapped element. If it is, focus is moved to the opposite end of the trapped element, effectively trapping focus within that element.\n\nThe `FocusTrap` component itself is a simple wrapper around the trapped element. It takes a single prop called `children`, which should be the content that should be trapped. When the `FocusTrap` component is mounted, it attaches the `ref` returned by `useFocusTrap` to a `div` element that wraps the `children`. This `div` element is given a `tabIndex` of `0`, which makes it focusable. When the `div` element receives focus, focus is automatically moved to the first focusable element within the trapped element.\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple way to ensure that users cannot accidentally tab out of a specific part of a web page. By wrapping content in a `FocusTrap` component, developers can ensure that users can only interact with that content until they explicitly close or dismiss it.",

The purpose of this hook is to determine whether a component is currently mounted or not. \n\nThe hook uses the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks from the React library. The `useState` hook initializes a state variable called `mounted` to `false`. The `useEffect` hook is used to update the `mounted` state variable to `true` when the component is mounted. The second argument to `useEffect` is an empty array, which means that the effect will only run once when the component is mounted.\n\nThe `useIsMounted` hook returns the `mounted` state variable, which will be `true` if the component is mounted and `false` otherwise. This can be useful in situations where you need to conditionally render content based on whether a component is mounted or not. For example, you might want to fetch data from an API when a component is mounted, but not when it is unmounted. You could use the `useIsMounted` hook to conditionally fetch the data only when the component is mounted.\n\nHere is an example of how you might use the `useIsMounted` hook in a component:\n\n```\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport useIsMounted from './useIsMounted'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const isMounted = useIsMounted()\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (isMounted) {\n      // Fetch data from API\n    }\n  }, [isMounted])\n\n  return (\n    // Render component\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `useEffect` hook will only fetch data from the API if the component is currently mounted.

This hook is part of the Alephium project and is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\nThe `usePrevious` hook takes two arguments: `value` and `initial`. The `value` argument is the current value of the variable that the developer wants to track, while the `initial` argument is an optional initial value that will be returned if there is no previous value.\n\nThe hook uses the `useRef` and `useEffect` hooks from React to store and update the previous value of the variable. The `useRef` hook creates a mutable object that persists for the lifetime of the component, while the `useEffect` hook is used to update the previous value when the `value` argument changes.\n\nThe `usePrevious` hook works by comparing the current `value` argument to the previous `target` value stored in the `ref` object. If the `value` argument has changed, the hook updates the `previous` value to the previous `target` value and updates the `target` value to the new `value` argument.\n\nThis hook can be useful in scenarios where developers need to track changes to a variable and perform some action based on the previous value. For example, if a developer is building a form and wants to show an error message when a user changes a field value, they can use the `usePrevious` hook to compare the current and previous values of the field and show the error message if the values are different.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `usePrevious` hook:\n\n```\nimport React, { useState } from 'react'\nimport usePrevious from './usePrevious'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n  const previousCount = usePrevious(count)\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Current count: {count}</p>\n      <p>Previous count: {previousCount}</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `usePrevious` hook is used to track changes to the `count` variable and display the current and previous values of the variable.

The hook is designed to be used in a React component and takes two parameters: the transaction ID and a callback function that will be called whenever the transaction status changes. \n\nThe hook uses the `@alephium/web3` library to interact with the Alephium blockchain. It first gets the default Alephium wallet using the `getDefaultAlephiumWallet` function from the `@alephium/get-extension-wallet` library. If the wallet object is not initialized, an error is thrown. The `web3.setCurrentNodeProvider` function is then called to set the node provider to the one provided by the Alephium wallet.\n\nThe hook then creates a subscription to the transaction status using the `subscribeToTxStatus` function from the `@alephium/web3` library. The subscription options are defined in the `subscriptionOptions` object, which includes a polling interval of 3 seconds, a message callback function that updates the transaction status and calls the provided callback function, and an error callback function that logs any errors and unsubscribes from the subscription.\n\nThe hook returns the current transaction status as a state variable, which can be used to render the component based on the current status of the transaction. \n\nHere is an example of how the hook can be used in a React component:\n\n```\nimport { useTxStatus } from './useTxStatus'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const { txStatus } = useTxStatus('0x123456789abcdef')\n\n  if (txStatus === undefined) {\n    return <div>Loading...</div>\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Transaction status: {txStatus.type}</p>\n      <p>Transaction hash: {txStatus.hash}</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `useTxStatus` hook is called with a transaction ID of `0x123456789abcdef`.

For example, the `--ck-font-family` variable sets the font family for the entire application, while the `--ck-focus-color` variable defines the color for focused elements.\n\nSome variables are specific to certain UI components, like the primary and secondary buttons. The primary button styling is defined by variables like `--ck-primary-button-background`, `--ck-primary-button-box-shadow`, and `--ck-primary-button-border-radius`. Similarly, the secondary button styling is defined by variables like `--ck-secondary-button-color`, `--ck-secondary-button-border-radius`, and `--ck-secondary-button-box-shadow`.\n\nOther variables are related to modals, tooltips, dropdowns, and alerts. For instance, the `--ck-modal-box-shadow` variable sets the box shadow for modals, while the `--ck-tooltip-background` variable defines the background color for tooltips.\n\nHere's an example of how these variables can be used in a CSS file:\n\n```css\n.button-primary {\n  background: var(--ck-primary-button-background);\n  box-shadow: var(--ck-primary-button-box-shadow);\n  border-radius: var(--ck-primary-button-border-radius);\n}\n```\n\nBy using these custom properties, developers can easily apply consistent styling to various elements throughout the Alephium-web3 project, ensuring a cohesive user experience.",

The purpose of this code is to provide a way for users to connect their wallets to the Alephium network. \n\nThe function takes in an object called `_walletOptions` as an argument, but this argument is not used in the function. Instead, the function returns an object with the following properties:\n\n- `id`: A string representing the ID of the wallet connector. In this case, it is set to `'walletConnect'`.\n- `name`: A string representing the name of the wallet connector. In this case, it is set to `'Other Wallets'`.\n- `logos`: An object with properties representing different logos for the wallet connector. The logos are imported from a file called `Logos` located in the `assets` directory. There are five different logos: `default`, `mobile`, `transparent`, `connectorButton`, and `qrCode`. Each logo is a React component that renders an SVG image. The `background` prop is used to determine whether the logo should have a background color or not.\n- `logoBackground`: A string representing the background color of the logo. In this case, it is set to `'var(--ck-brand-walletConnect)'`.\n- `scannable`: A boolean representing whether the wallet connector can be scanned. In this case, it is set to `true`.\n\nThis code is used in the larger Alephium project to provide a standardized way for users to connect their wallets to the network. By defining a set of properties for each wallet connector, the project can ensure that each connector has a consistent look and feel. Other files in the project can import this function and use it to display a list of available wallet connectors to the user. For example:\n\n```\nimport { walletConnect } from 'alephium-web3'\n\nconst walletConnectProps = walletConnect()\n// Display walletConnectProps in a list of available wallet connectors\n```",

What is the `WalletProps` type and where is it defined?\n   The `WalletProps` type is imported from a file located at `./../wallet`. The definition of this type is not shown in this code snippet.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `Logos` import and how is it used in this code?\n   The `Logos` import is used to access different logos related to the wallet integration. These logos are then assigned to the `logos` property of the object returned by the `walletConnect` function."

      "summary": "The code in the `wallets` folder of the `alephium-web3` project provides a set of functions and interfaces to interact with different types of cryptocurrency wallets. It includes three wallet connectors (`injected`, `walletConnect`, and `desktopWallet`) that can be used to interact with wallets such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Alephium Desktop Wallet.\n\nThe `getWallets` function in `index.ts` returns an array of these wallet connectors, which can be used in other parts of the Alephium project to interact with different types of wallets. For example:\n\n```javascript\nimport { getWallets } from 'alephium-web3'\n\nconst wallets = getWallets({})\nconsole.log(wallets) // [injected({}), walletConnect({}), desktopWallet()]\n```\n\nThe `useDefaultWallets.tsx` file provides a function called `useDefaultWallets` that returns an array of `WalletProps` objects, which can be used to display a list of default wallets in a user interface or for testing purposes. Here's an example of how it might be used in a React component:\n\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react'\nimport useDefaultWallets from 'alephium-web3'\n\nfunction WalletList() {\n  const wallets = useDefaultWallets()\n\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {wallets.map(wallet => (\n        <li key={wallet.address}>\n          {wallet.address} - {wallet.balance}\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe `wallet.ts` file defines two interfaces, `WalletOptions` and `WalletProps`, which are used to define the options and properties of a wallet component in the Alephium project. These interfaces can be used by developers to create new wallet components and pass in the appropriate options and properties:\n\n```javascript\nimport { WalletOptions, WalletProps } from 'alephium-web3'\n\nconst walletOptions: WalletOptions = {\n  appName: 'My App',\n  shimDisconnect: true\n}\n\nconst walletProps: WalletProps = {\n  id: 'my-wallet',\n  name: 'My Wallet',\n  shortName: 'MW',\n  logos: {\n    default: <MyWalletLogo />,\n    transparent: <MyWalletLogoTransparent />,\n    connectorButton: <MyWalletConnectorButton />,\n    qrCode: <MyWalletQRCode />,\n    appIcon: <MyWalletAppIcon />,\n    mobile: <MyWalletMobileLogo />\n  },\n  logoBackground: '#FFFFFF',\n  scannable: true,\n  installed: true,\n  downloadUrls: {\n    windows: 'https://my-wallet.com/windows',\n    mac: 'https://my-wallet.com/mac',\n    linux: 'https://my-wallet.com/linux'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `connectors` subfolder contains functions that return wallet connector configurations for different types of wallets. These configurations can be used by other parts of the Alephium project to interact with wallets and display wallet options to the user. For example, to display a list of available wallet connectors:\n\n```javascript\nimport { walletConnect } from 'alephium-web3'\n\nconst walletConnectProps = walletConnect()\n// Display walletConnectProps in a list of available wallet connectors\n```\n\nOverall, the code in the `wallets` folder provides a set of functions and interfaces for interacting with different types of cryptocurrency wallets in the Alephium project.
