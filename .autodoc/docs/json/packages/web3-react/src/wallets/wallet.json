  "summary": "This file contains TypeScript code that defines two interfaces: `WalletOptions` and `WalletProps`. These interfaces are used to define the options and properties of a wallet component in the Alephium web3 project.\n\nThe `WalletOptions` interface defines two optional properties: `appName` and `shimDisconnect`. The `appName` property is a string that represents the name of the application that is using the wallet component. The `shimDisconnect` property is a boolean that indicates whether the wallet should disconnect from the application when it is closed.\n\nThe `WalletProps` interface defines several required properties: `id`, `name`, and `logos`, as well as several optional properties: `shortName`, `logoBackground`, `scannable`, `installed`, and `downloadUrls`. The `id` property is a string that represents the unique identifier of the wallet component. The `name` property is a string that represents the name of the wallet. The `shortName` property is an optional string that represents a shortened version of the wallet name. The `logos` property is an object that contains several ReactNode properties that represent different logos for the wallet component. The `logoBackground` property is an optional string that represents the background color of the wallet logo. The `scannable` property is an optional boolean that indicates whether the wallet can be scanned. The `installed` property is an optional boolean that indicates whether the wallet is installed. The `downloadUrls` property is an optional object that contains key-value pairs of download URLs for the wallet component.\n\nThese interfaces are used throughout the Alephium web3 project to define the options and properties of wallet components. For example, a developer might use these interfaces to create a new wallet component and pass in the appropriate options and properties. Here is an example of how these interfaces might be used:\n\n```\nimport { WalletOptions, WalletProps } from 'alephium-web3'\n\nconst walletOptions: WalletOptions = {\n  appName: 'My App',\n  shimDisconnect: true\n}\n\nconst walletProps: WalletProps = {\n  id: 'my-wallet',\n  name: 'My Wallet',\n  shortName: 'MW',\n  logos: {\n    default: <MyWalletLogo />,\n    transparent: <MyWalletLogoTransparent />,\n    connectorButton: <MyWalletConnectorButton />,\n    qrCode: <MyWalletQRCode />,\n    appIcon: <MyWalletAppIcon />,\n    mobile: <MyWalletMobileLogo />\n  },\n  logoBackground: '#FFFFFF',\n  scannable: true,\n  installed: true,\n  downloadUrls: {\n    windows: 'https://my-wallet.com/windows',\n    mac: 'https://my-wallet.com/mac',\n    linux: 'https://my-wallet.com/linux'\n  }\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file defines two types, `WalletOptions` and `WalletProps`, which are likely used in a React component related to wallets.\n\n2. What is the license for this code?\n- This code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later.\n\n3. What is the expected format and content of the `WalletProps` type?\n- The `WalletProps` type includes several properties related to a wallet, such as `id`, `name`, and `logos`. It also includes optional properties such as `shortName`, `logoBackground`, and `downloadUrls`."
