      "summary": "This code defines a function called `getWallets` that returns an array of three different wallet connectors. These connectors are used to interact with different types of cryptocurrency wallets in the Alephium project.\n\nThe first connector is called `injected` and is imported from the `./connectors/injected` file. This connector is used to interact with wallets that are injected into the browser, such as MetaMask. The `injected` function takes an empty object as an argument and returns an object with methods for interacting with the injected wallet.\n\nThe second connector is called `walletConnect` and is imported from the `./connectors/walletConnect` file. This connector is used to interact with wallets that support the WalletConnect protocol, such as Trust Wallet. The `walletConnect` function takes an empty object as an argument and returns an object with methods for interacting with the WalletConnect wallet.\n\nThe third connector is called `desktopWallet` and is imported from the `./connectors/desktopWallet` file. This connector is used to interact with wallets that are installed on the user's desktop, such as Alephium Desktop Wallet. The `desktopWallet` function takes an empty object as an argument and returns an object with methods for interacting with the desktop wallet.\n\nThe `getWallets` function takes an optional object as an argument with two properties: `appName` and `shimDisconnect`. These properties are not used in the function and are therefore left empty. The function then returns an array of the three wallet connectors, which can be used in other parts of the Alephium project to interact with different types of wallets.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { getWallets } from 'alephium-web3'\n\nconst wallets = getWallets({})\nconsole.log(wallets) // [injected({}), walletConnect({}), desktopWallet()]\n```",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file is part of the Alephium project and contains a function that returns an array of wallet connectors.\n\n2.

Are there any parameters that can be passed to the `getWallets` function?\n- Yes, the `getWallets` function takes an object as its parameter with optional properties `appName` and `shimDisconnect`."

      "summary": "This code defines a function called `useDefaultWallets` that returns an array of `WalletProps` objects. The purpose of this function is to provide a default set of wallets for the Alephium project. \n\nThe function imports another function called `getWallets` from a file located in the same directory. This function is not defined in the code provided, but it is likely that it retrieves a list of wallets from some source, such as a database or API. The `getWallets` function takes an empty object as an argument, which suggests that it may have additional options for filtering or sorting the list of wallets.\n\nThe `useDefaultWallets` function simply calls `getWallets` with an empty object and returns the resulting array of `WalletProps` objects. It is not clear from the code what properties are included in a `WalletProps` object, but it can be assumed that they contain information about a wallet, such as its address, balance, and transaction history.\n\nThis function may be used in the larger Alephium project to provide a default set of wallets for testing or demonstration purposes. For example, if the project includes a user interface for managing wallets, the `useDefaultWallets` function could be used to populate the initial list of wallets displayed to the user. Alternatively, the function could be used in automated tests to ensure that certain wallets are always present and have expected properties.\n\nHere is an example of how the `useDefaultWallets` function might be used in a React component:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react'\nimport useDefaultWallets from 'alephium-web3'\n\nfunction WalletList() {\n  const wallets = useDefaultWallets()\n\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {wallets.map(wallet => (\n        <li key={wallet.address}>\n          {wallet.address} - {wallet.balance}\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `useDefaultWallets` function is called to retrieve an array of wallets, which are then mapped to a list of `<li>` elements displaying the wallet address and balance. This component could be used to display a list of default wallets in a user interface.",
      "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `getWallets` function being imported from `./`?\n   - The smart developer might ask what the `getWallets` function does and what its parameters are, as it is being used in the `useDefaultWallets` function.\n\n2. What is the expected output of the `useDefaultWallets` function?\n   - The smart developer might ask what the `useDefaultWallets` function returns and how it is being used in the project.\n\n3. Are there any other functions or variables being exported from this file?\n   - The smart developer might ask if there are any other exports from this file besides the `useDefaultWallets` function, as it is the only export being explicitly defined."

      "summary": "This file contains TypeScript code that defines two interfaces: `WalletOptions` and `WalletProps`. These interfaces are used to define the options and properties of a wallet component in the Alephium web3 project.\n\nThe `WalletOptions` interface defines two optional properties: `appName` and `shimDisconnect`. The `appName` property is a string that represents the name of the application that is using the wallet component. The `shimDisconnect` property is a boolean that indicates whether the wallet should disconnect from the application when it is closed.\n\nThe `WalletProps` interface defines several required properties: `id`, `name`, and `logos`, as well as several optional properties: `shortName`, `logoBackground`, `scannable`, `installed`, and `downloadUrls`. The `id` property is a string that represents the unique identifier of the wallet component. The `name` property is a string that represents the name of the wallet. The `shortName` property is an optional string that represents a shortened version of the wallet name. The `logos` property is an object that contains several ReactNode properties that represent different logos for the wallet component. The `logoBackground` property is an optional string that represents the background color of the wallet logo. The `scannable` property is an optional boolean that indicates whether the wallet can be scanned. The `installed` property is an optional boolean that indicates whether the wallet is installed. The `downloadUrls` property is an optional object that contains key-value pairs of download URLs for the wallet component.\n\nThese interfaces are used throughout the Alephium web3 project to define the options and properties of wallet components. For example, a developer might use these interfaces to create a new wallet component and pass in the appropriate options and properties. Here is an example of how these interfaces might be used:\n\n```\nimport { WalletOptions, WalletProps } from 'alephium-web3'\n\nconst walletOptions: WalletOptions = {\n  appName: 'My App',\n  shimDisconnect: true\n}\n\nconst walletProps: WalletProps = {\n  id: 'my-wallet',\n  name: 'My Wallet',\n  shortName: 'MW',\n  logos: {\n    default: <MyWalletLogo />,\n    transparent: <MyWalletLogoTransparent />,\n    connectorButton: <MyWalletConnectorButton />,\n    qrCode: <MyWalletQRCode />,\n    appIcon: <MyWalletAppIcon />,\n    mobile: <MyWalletMobileLogo />\n  },\n  logoBackground: '#FFFFFF',\n  scannable: true,\n  installed: true,\n  downloadUrls: {\n    windows: 'https://my-wallet.com/windows',\n    mac: 'https://my-wallet.com/mac',\n    linux: 'https://my-wallet.com/linux'\n  }\n}\n```",

What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file defines two types, `WalletOptions` and `WalletProps`, which are likely used in a React component related to wallets.\n\n2.

What is the expected format and content of the `WalletProps` type?\n- The `WalletProps` type includes several properties related to a wallet, such as `id`, `name`, and `logos`. It also includes optional properties such as `shortName`, `logoBackground`, and `downloadUrls`."
