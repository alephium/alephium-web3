  "summary": "This code defines a function called `injected` that returns an object with properties related to a wallet. The purpose of this code is to provide information about a wallet that is injected into a web3 provider. \n\nThe function takes an argument called `_walletOptions`, but it is not used in the function. Instead, the function first checks if the `window` object is defined, which indicates that the wallet is installed as a browser extension. If the `window` object is not defined, the function checks if the user is on a mobile device and if the wallet is not installed. If both conditions are true, the function sets a flag to indicate that the wallet should use WalletConnect, which is a protocol for connecting wallets to decentralized applications. \n\nThe function then returns an object with the following properties:\n- `id`: a string that identifies the wallet as \"injected\"\n- `name`: a string that describes the name of the wallet as \"Extension Wallet\"\n- `shortName`: a string that provides a shorter name for the wallet as \"browser\"\n- `scannable`: a boolean that indicates whether the wallet can be scanned (presumably by a QR code)\n- `logos`: an object that contains a default logo for the wallet, which is an Alephium icon\n- `installed`: a boolean that indicates whether the wallet is installed. If the `shouldUseWalletConnect` flag is true, this property is set to false, otherwise it is set to true if the `window` object is defined. \n\nThis code is likely used in a larger project that interacts with a web3 provider and needs to detect the presence of a wallet. The `injected` function provides information about the wallet that can be used to display wallet options to the user or to determine which wallet to use for a particular transaction. For example, the `logos` property could be used to display the Alephium icon next to the wallet name. The `installed` property could be used to determine whether to display a message to the user to install the wallet. Overall, this code provides a simple way to detect the presence of a wallet and provide information about it to the user.",
