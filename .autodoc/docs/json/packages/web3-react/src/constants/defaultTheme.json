  "summary": "This code exports a single object with a property called `mobileWidth` set to the value of 560. The purpose of this code is to provide a constant value for the minimum width of a mobile device screen. This value can be used throughout the larger project to ensure that certain UI elements are properly displayed on mobile devices.\n\nFor example, if a developer is working on a responsive design for a website using the alephium-web3 library, they can use this `mobileWidth` value to determine when to switch from a desktop layout to a mobile layout. They can set a media query in their CSS to apply certain styles only when the screen width is less than or equal to `mobileWidth`.\n\n```\n@media (max-width: ${mobileWidth}px) {\n  /* apply mobile-specific styles here */\n}\n```\n\nBy using this constant value, the developer can ensure that the website will look and function properly on mobile devices without having to hardcode a specific pixel value for the mobile breakpoint. This can make the code more maintainable and adaptable to different screen sizes.\n\nOverall, this code serves as a small but important piece of the larger alephium-web3 project, providing a consistent value for mobile screen width that can be used throughout the project to ensure a responsive design.",
