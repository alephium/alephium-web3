  "summary": "This code is a configuration file for the rollup bundler for a library called alephium-web3. The purpose of this configuration file is to specify how the library should be bundled and what dependencies should be excluded from the bundle. \n\nThe configuration file specifies that the input file for the bundler is located at './src/index.ts'. The external array specifies that the dependencies 'react', 'react-dom', and 'framer-motion' should be excluded from the bundle. The output specifies that the bundled library should be exported as an ES module and should be written to the file specified in the 'exports' field of the package.json file. \n\nThe configuration file also specifies two plugins to be used by the bundler. The first plugin, 'peerDepsExternal', is used to exclude peer dependencies from the bundle. The second plugin, 'typescript', is used to transpile TypeScript code to JavaScript. \n\nThis configuration file is an important part of the alephium-web3 library because it specifies how the library should be bundled and what dependencies should be excluded from the bundle. Developers who use this library can modify this configuration file to customize the bundling process to their needs. \n\nExample usage:\n\nSuppose a developer wants to modify the output format of the alephium-web3 library to CommonJS instead of ES module. They can modify the configuration file as follows:\n\n```\nexport default [\n  {\n    input: ['./src/index.ts'],\n    external: ['react', 'react-dom', 'framer-motion'],\n    output: [\n      {\n        file: packageJson.main,\n        format: 'cjs',\n        sourcemap: false\n      }\n    ],\n    plugins: [\n      peerDepsExternal(),\n      typescript({\n        useTsconfigDeclarationDir: true,\n        exclude: 'node_modules/**'\n      })\n    ]\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThis will change the output format of the library to CommonJS and write the bundled library to the file specified in the 'main' field of the package.json file.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file is used to configure the build process for the alephium-web3 library.\n\n2. What dependencies are required for this code to run?\n- This code requires the `rollup-plugin-peer-deps-external` and `rollup-plugin-typescript2` dependencies.\n\n3. What is the output format of the build process?\n- The output format of the build process is `esm` (ECMAScript module)."
