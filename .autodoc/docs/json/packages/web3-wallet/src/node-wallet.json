  "summary": "This file contains the implementation of a NodeWallet class that extends the SignerProviderWithMultipleAccounts class from the `@alephium/web3` library. The NodeWallet class is used to interact with a wallet on the Alephium blockchain network. \n\nThe NodeWallet class has a constructor that takes in a wallet name, a node provider, and an explorer provider. The wallet name is a string that identifies the wallet on the network. The node provider is an instance of the NodeProvider class that is used to interact with the Alephium node. The explorer provider is an instance of the ExplorerProvider class that is used to interact with the Alephium explorer. If no node provider or explorer provider is provided, the constructor uses the default providers from the web3 library.\n\nThe NodeWallet class has several methods that can be used to interact with the wallet. The `setSelectedAccount` method is used to set the active account for the wallet. The method takes in an address and makes a POST request to the Alephium node to change the active address for the wallet. \n\nThe `getAccounts` method is used to get a list of accounts associated with the wallet. The method makes a GET request to the Alephium node to get the addresses associated with the wallet and returns an array of Account objects. \n\nThe `unsafeGetSelectedAccount` method is used to get the currently selected account for the wallet. The method makes a GET request to the Alephium node to get the addresses associated with the wallet and returns the Account object for the active address.\n\nThe `signRaw` method is used to sign a raw transaction with the wallet. The method takes in a signer address and a hex string and makes a POST request to the Alephium node to sign the transaction with the wallet. \n\nThe `unlock` method is used to unlock the wallet with a password. The method takes in a password and makes a POST request to the Alephium node to unlock the wallet. \n\nThe `lock` method is used to lock the wallet. The method makes a POST request to the Alephium node to lock the wallet.\n\nOverall, the NodeWallet class provides a convenient way to interact with a wallet on the Alephium blockchain network. It can be used to get a list of accounts associated with the wallet, set the active account, sign transactions, and lock/unlock the wallet.",
