This file contains functions for encrypting and decrypting data using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm with a 256-bit key and Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) for authenticated encryption. The purpose of this code is to provide a secure way to store and transmit sensitive data, such as passwords or private keys, within the Alephium project.

The `encrypt` function takes a password and a string of data as input, and returns a JSON string containing the encrypted data, along with the salt and initialization vector (IV) used for key derivation and encryption. The password is used to derive a key using the Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) with a randomly generated salt. The data is then encrypted using the derived key and a randomly generated IV, and the resulting ciphertext is concatenated with the authentication tag generated by the GCM mode. The salt, IV, encrypted data, and version number are then combined into a payload object and returned as a JSON string.

The `decrypt` function takes a password and a JSON string containing the encrypted data as input, and returns the decrypted data as a string. The function first parses the JSON payload and checks the version number to ensure compatibility. It then extracts the salt, IV, and encrypted data from the payload, and derives the key using the same PBKDF2 function with the salt. The encrypted data is decrypted using the derived key, IV, and authentication tag, and the resulting plaintext is returned as a string.

The `createCipher` and `createDecipher` functions are helper functions that create instances of the AES-256-GCM cipher and decipher objects, respectively, using the `createCipheriv` and `createDecipheriv` functions from the `crypto` module. The `keyFromPassword` function is a helper function that uses the `pbkdf2Sync` function from the `crypto` module to derive a key from a password and a salt.

Here is an example usage of the `encrypt` and `decrypt` functions:

```
const password = 'mysecretpassword'
const data = 'sensitivedata'

const encrypted = encrypt(password, data)
console.log(encrypted)

const decrypted = decrypt(password, encrypted)
console.log(decrypted)
```

This will output the encrypted payload as a JSON string, and the decrypted data as a string.
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
- This code exports two functions, `encrypt` and `decrypt`, which use the `crypto` library to encrypt and decrypt data using a password and AES-256-GCM encryption.

2. What is the purpose of the `salt`, `iv`, and `authTag` variables?
- `salt` is a randomly generated value used to derive a key from the password using PBKDF2. `iv` is a randomly generated initialization vector used in the encryption process. `authTag` is a value generated by the encryption process that is used to verify the integrity of the encrypted data during decryption.

3. What encryption algorithm is being used?
- The code is using the AES-256-GCM encryption algorithm.
