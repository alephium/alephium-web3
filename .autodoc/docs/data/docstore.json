[["0",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium-web3/artifacts/add/add.ral.json)\n\nThis code represents a smart contract written in Solidity, a programming language used to create decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract is called \"Add\" and its bytecode is provided in the code snippet. The contract has four functions: \"add\", \"addPrivate\", \"createSubContract\", and \"destroy\". \n\nThe \"add\" function is a public function that takes an array of two 256-bit unsigned integers and returns an array of two 256-bit unsigned integers. The function adds the two integers in the input array and returns the result. \n\nThe \"addPrivate\" function is a private function that takes an array of two 256-bit unsigned integers and returns an array of two 256-bit unsigned integers. The function adds the two integers in the input array and returns the result. However, this function is not accessible to the public and can only be called by other functions within the contract. \n\nThe \"createSubContract\" function is a public function that creates a new sub-contract. It takes four parameters: a 256-bit unsigned integer, a byte vector, a byte vector, and an address. The function creates a new sub-contract with the given parameters and returns nothing. \n\nThe \"destroy\" function is a public function that destroys the contract. It takes one parameter, an address, and returns nothing. The function can only be called by the address provided as the parameter. \n\nThe contract also includes an events signature, which defines two events: \"Add\" and \"Add1\". Both events have two fields, \"x\" and \"y\", which are 256-bit unsigned integers. \n\nOverall, this contract provides basic functionality for adding two 256-bit unsigned integers and creating and destroying sub-contracts. It can be used as a building block for more complex smart contracts that require these functionalities. Below is an example of how the \"add\" function can be called in Solidity:\n\n```\ncontract MyContract {\n  function addNumbers(uint256 a, uint256 b) public returns (uint256[2] memory) {\n    uint256[2] memory input = [a, b];\n    return Add.add(input);\n  }\n}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n- This code represents the bytecode, function signatures, and events signatures for a smart contract called \"Add\" in the Alephium blockchain.\n\n2. What are the input and output types for the \"add\" function?\n- The \"add\" function takes in an array of two U256 values and returns an array of two U256 values.\n\n3. What is the difference between the \"add\" and \"addPrivate\" functions?\n- The \"add\" function is public and can be called by anyone, while the \"addPrivate\" function is not public and can only be called by the contract itself or a designated authority.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/artifacts/add/add.ral.md"}}],["1",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium-web3/artifacts/add/destroy_add.ral.json)\n\nThis code represents a smart contract template called \"DestroyAdd\" that can be used in the Alephium blockchain network. The purpose of this contract is to allow a user to destroy a specified asset by adding it to a blacklist. The contract is written in bytecode and includes a version number, a name, and a template for the bytecode. \n\nThe contract has two fields: \"add\" and \"caller\". \"add\" is a ByteVec (a vector of bytes) that represents the asset to be destroyed, and \"caller\" is the address of the user who is calling the contract. Both fields are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once the contract is deployed. \n\nThe contract also includes a single function called \"main\". This function is marked as public, meaning it can be called by anyone on the network. It takes no parameters and returns nothing. The purpose of this function is to add the specified asset to a blacklist, effectively destroying it. \n\nThe contract includes two options for handling assets: \"usePreapprovedAssets\" and \"useAssetsInContract\". If \"usePreapprovedAssets\" is set to true, the contract will only allow assets that have been pre-approved by the network to be destroyed. If \"useAssetsInContract\" is set to true, the contract will allow any asset to be destroyed as long as it is included in the contract's bytecode. \n\nOverall, this contract provides a simple and secure way for users to destroy assets on the Alephium network. It can be used as a template for creating similar contracts with different asset types or destruction criteria. \n\nExample usage:\n\nAssuming the contract has been deployed on the network, a user can call the \"main\" function to destroy a specified asset. For example, if the asset to be destroyed is a token with the ID \"0x123456\", the user would call the function with the following parameters:\n\nadd: [0x12, 0x34, 0x56]\ncaller: [address of user]\n\nThis would add the token to the blacklist and effectively destroy it.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this contract?\n- This contract is called \"DestroyAdd\" and its purpose is not clear from the provided code. \n\n2.

Each namespace exports an `execute` function and a `script` object. The `execute` function takes a `SignerProvider` and an `ExecuteScriptParams` object as input and returns a `Promise` that resolves to an `ExecuteScriptResult` object. The `script` object contains a JSON representation of a script that can be executed on the Alephium blockchain.\n\nThe purpose of this file is to provide a convenient way to execute pre-defined scripts on the Alephium blockchain. Each namespace corresponds to a different script, and the `execute` function takes care of signing and submitting the transaction to the blockchain. The `script` object contains the JSON representation of the script that is being executed.\n\nFor example, to execute the `DestroyAdd` script, you would call the `execute` function on the `DestroyAdd` namespace, passing in a `SignerProvider` and an `ExecuteScriptParams` object. The `SignerProvider` is responsible for signing the transaction, and the `ExecuteScriptParams` object contains the parameters that are passed to the script. The `execute` function returns a `Promise` that resolves to an `ExecuteScriptResult` object, which contains information about the execution of the script.\n\nHere is an example of how to execute the `DestroyAdd` script:\n\n```typescript\nimport { DestroyAdd } from \"@alephium/web3\";\n\nconst signer = ...; // create a SignerProvider\nconst params = { add: \"0x123456789abcdef\", caller: \"0x987654321fedcba\" }; // set the parameters\nconst result = await DestroyAdd.execute(signer, params); // execute the script\nconsole.log(result); // print the result\n```\n\nOverall, this file provides a convenient way to execute pre-defined scripts on the Alephium blockchain, making it easier for developers to interact with the blockchain.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file contains namespaces and functions for executing scripts related to different contracts in the Alephium blockchain.\n\n2. What are the parameters required for the `execute` function in each namespace?\n- The `execute` function in each namespace requires a `signer` object and `params` object with specific properties depending on the namespace. For example, the `DestroyAdd` namespace requires `params` to have an `add` property of type `HexString` and a `caller` property of type `Address`.\n\n3. What is the role of the `Script` object in each namespace?\n- The `Script` object in each namespace is used to parse a JSON file containing the script code for the corresponding contract. The resulting `Script` object is then used to generate transaction parameters and sign and submit the transaction using the `signer` object.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/artifacts/ts/scripts.md"}}],["23",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium-web3/configs/header.js)\n\nThis code is a license file for the Alephium project, which is a library of free software that can be redistributed and modified under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

It takes two arguments: the path to the devnet directory, and the name of the file containing the full node software. It first checks if a devnet is already running by reading the PID (process ID) from a file in the devnet directory. If a PID is found, it kills the running process. It then deletes several directories and files in the devnet directory to ensure a clean start. Finally, it launches the full node software as a child process using the `spawn` module, passing several environment variables to configure the software. The PID of the child process is saved to a file in the devnet directory. \n\nThe `testWallet`, `testWalletPwd`, and `mnemonic` constants are used to create a test wallet for use in the devnet. \n\nThe `prepareWallet`, `createWallet`, and `unlockWallet` functions are used to create and unlock the test wallet. `prepareWallet` first checks if the test wallet exists, and if it does, unlocks it. If the test wallet does not exist, `createWallet` is called to create it. `createWallet` sends an HTTP PUT request to the devnet to create the wallet, passing the test wallet name, password, and mnemonic as parameters. It then sends an HTTP POST request to set the active address of the wallet. `unlockWallet` sends an HTTP POST request to unlock the test wallet. \n\nThe `timeout` and `wait` functions are used to wait for the devnet to become live. `timeout` returns a promise that resolves after a specified number of milliseconds. `wait` calls `isDevnetLive` to check if the devnet is live.

If it is, it waits for one second and then returns a resolved promise. \n\nThe `startDevnet` function is the main function of the file. It takes two arguments: the version tag of the full node software to use, and the path to the configuration file to use. It first downloads the full node software and copies the configuration file to the devnet directory. It then checks if the devnet is already running by calling `isDevnetLive`. If it is, it prints an error message and exits.

Loads the deployments from the configuration file for the `devnet` network.\n5. Iterates through each account in the test wallet and performs the following steps:\n   1. Sets the active account to prepare and sign transactions.\n   2. Retrieves the metadata of the deployed `TokenFaucet` contract in the account's group.\n   3. If the contract is not deployed in the group, the script logs a message and continues to the next account.\n   4. Otherwise, the script retrieves the contract ID and address.\n   5. Submits a transaction to withdraw tokens from the `TokenFaucet` contract using the `Withdraw` transaction script.\n   6. Retrieves the latest state of the `TokenFaucet` contract using the `TokenFaucet` contract instance.\n   7. Prints the state of the contract.\n\nFinally, the `withdraw()` function is called to execute the script.\n\nThis code can be used as a reference for developers who want to interact with smart contracts on the Alephium blockchain using the `@alephium/web3` library.

It defines a `Settings` type with a single property `issueTokenAmount` of type `Number256` and a `defaultSettings` object with a default value of 100n for the `issueTokenAmount` property. The configuration object has three network configurations: `devnet`, `testnet`, and `mainnet`, each with a `nodeUrl` property specifying the Alephium node URL to connect to. The `devnet` network configuration also has a `privateKeys` property for deploying contracts.\n\nExample usage of the configuration file:\n\n```typescript\nimport configuration, { Settings } from './configuration'\n\n// Connect to the devnet network\nconst devnetSettings: Settings = configuration.networks.devnet.settings\nconst nodeUrl: string = configuration.networks.devnet.nodeUrl\nconst privateKeys: string[] = configuration.networks.devnet.privateKeys\n\n// Use the settings and nodeUrl to connect to the Alephium node and deploy contracts\n// Use the privateKeys to sign transactions\n```\n\nThe `scripts` folder contains the `0_deploy_faucet.ts` script, which deploys the `TokenFaucet` contract on the Alephium blockchain network. The script imports necessary modules and defines a `deploy` function that takes in a `Deployer` object and a `Network` object as parameters. The `Deployer` object is used to deploy the contract, while the `Network` object provides access to the network settings.\n\nExample usage of the `deployFaucet` script:\n\n```javascript\nimport deployFaucet from './deployFaucet'\n\ndeployFaucet()\n```\n\nThe `src` folder contains the `token.ts` file, which demonstrates how to interact with a smart contract deployed on the Alephium blockchain using the `@alephium/web3` library. The script focuses on withdrawing tokens from a `TokenFaucet` contract and printing the latest state of the contract. The main function in the script is the asynchronous `withdraw()` function, which sets the current node provider, builds the contracts, retrieves a test wallet, loads the deployments, and iterates through each account in the test wallet to withdraw tokens and print the state of the contract.\n\nDevelopers can modify the code in the `token.ts` file to interact with other contracts and networks by changing the configuration file and the contract names. For example, to interact with a different contract, developers can import the contract artifacts and replace the `TokenFaucet` and `Withdraw` imports with the new contract and transaction script. Additionally, developers can change the node provider URL and network configuration to work with different networks.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/packages/cli/templates/base/summary.md"}}],["56",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium-web3/packages/cli/templates/react/config-overrides.js)\n\nThis code exports a function that overrides the default configuration of a webpack build.

It specifies various options for the compiler to use when compiling TypeScript code into JavaScript. \n\nThe `\"outDir\"` option specifies the output directory for compiled JavaScript files. The `\"target\"` option specifies the version of ECMAScript to target. The `\"allowJs\"` option allows the compiler to compile JavaScript files as well as TypeScript files. The `\"esModuleInterop\"` option enables interoperability between CommonJS and ES6 modules. The `\"strict\"` option enables strict type checking. The `\"noImplicitAny\"` option disallows the use of the `any` type. The `\"allowSyntheticDefaultImports\"` option allows for default imports from modules with no default export. The `\"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\"` option enforces consistent casing in file names. The `\"module\"` option specifies the module system to use. The `\"declaration\"` option generates corresponding `.d.ts` files. The `\"moduleResolution\"` option specifies how modules should be resolved. The `\"resolveJsonModule\"` option allows for importing JSON files as modules. The `\"experimentalDecorators\"` option enables experimental support for decorators. The `\"noImplicitOverride\"` option disallows implicit overrides of methods.\n\nThis configuration file is used by the TypeScript compiler to ensure that the TypeScript code in the alephium-web3 project is compiled correctly and with the desired options. For example, if a developer wants to use strict type checking, they can set `\"strict\": true` in this file and the compiler will enforce strict type checking. \n\nAn example of how this configuration file is used in the larger project is when a developer wants to compile TypeScript code into JavaScript. They would run the TypeScript compiler with this configuration file as an argument, and the compiler would use the options specified in this file to compile the code.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It specifies how to bundle the code in the `src/index.ts` file and output it to the `dist/` directory. The bundled code will be in the CommonJS format and will include a source map if the `production` flag is not set. \n\nThe configuration file uses several Rollup plugins to transform the code before bundling. The `@rollup/plugin-commonjs` plugin converts CommonJS modules to ES6 modules, which can be bundled by Rollup. The `@rollup/plugin-json` plugin allows importing JSON files as modules. The `@rollup/plugin-typescript` plugin compiles TypeScript code to JavaScript. The `rollup-plugin-esbuild` plugin uses the esbuild JavaScript bundler to optimize and minify the code. The `rollup-plugin-generate-declarations` plugin generates TypeScript declaration files for the bundled code. Finally, the `rollup-plugin-terser` plugin minifies the code further if the `production` flag is set.\n\nThis configuration file can be used to build the Alephium Web3 library, which provides a JavaScript API for interacting with the Alephium blockchain. The bundled code can be included in a web page or used in a Node.js application. For example, to use the library in a Node.js application, the following code can be used:\n\n```javascript\nconst AlephiumWeb3 = require('./dist/index.js');\n\nconst web3 = new AlephiumWeb3('http://localhost:1234');\n\nweb3.eth.getBlockNumber().then(console.log);\n```\n\nThis code imports the bundled Alephium Web3 library and creates a new instance of the `AlephiumWeb3` class, which connects to a local Alephium node. It then uses the `getBlockNumber` method of the `eth` object to retrieve the current block number and logs it to the console.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It provides a set of constants, types, and a provider class that can be used by other parts of the project to establish connections, sign and submit transactions, and handle events.\n\nFor example, the `WalletConnectProvider` class in `src/provider.ts` serves as a bridge between the Alephium blockchain and WalletConnect. It extends the `SignerProvider` class and provides methods for signing and submitting transactions, handling events, and managing the connection with WalletConnect. A dApp might use this class to enable users to sign and submit transactions securely from their mobile devices:\n\n```javascript\nimport { WalletConnectProvider } from 'alephium-web3';\n\nconst providerOptions = { /* ... */ };\nconst provider = new WalletConnectProvider(providerOptions);\n\nawait provider.connect();\n\nconst signedTx = await provider.signAndSubmitTransferTx(/* ... */);\n```\n\nThe `constants.ts` file in the `src` folder contains important constants used throughout the project, such as the Alephium provider identifier, relay methods, logging level, and relay URL. These constants ensure that various parts of the project work together properly.\n\nThe `types.ts` file in the `src` folder defines several types and interfaces used throughout the Alephium Web3 project, ensuring type safety and consistency. It includes types for relay methods, provider events, address groups, chain information, and project metadata.\n\nThe `artifacts` folder contains code for defining and interacting with smart contracts on the Alephium blockchain, specifically the `Greeter` contract. It provides JSON files that define the structure and behavior of the contracts, as well as TypeScript files for interacting with the Alephium blockchain through the `Greeter` contract. Developers can use this code to deploy the `Greeter` contract on the Alephium blockchain and interact with it using the alephium-web3 library.\n\nIn summary, the code in this folder is crucial for enabling dApps to interact with the Alephium blockchain through WalletConnect-compatible wallets. It provides a set of constants, types, and a provider class that can be used by other parts of the project to establish connections, sign and submit transactions, and handle events. Additionally, it offers a convenient way to define and interact with smart contracts on the Alephium blockchain using TypeScript, abstracting away many of the low-level details of interacting with the blockchain and making it easier for developers to build decentralized applications.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/packages/walletconnect/summary.md"}}],["90",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium-web3/packages/walletconnect/tsconfig.cjs.json)\n\nThis code is a configuration file for the TypeScript compiler.

If an `ApiRequestHandler` function is provided, the `ExplorerProvider` instance is created with a base URL of `https://1.2.3.4:0` and all requests are forwarded to the provided handler.\n\nThe `ExplorerProvider` class has several properties that correspond to different endpoints of the Alephium blockchain explorer API, such as `blocks`, `transactions`, `addresses`, `infos`, `mempool`, `tokens`, `charts`, `contracts`, and `contractEvents`. Each of these properties is an object that contains methods for interacting with the corresponding API endpoint.\n\nThe `ExplorerProvider` class also has a `request` method that takes an `ApiRequestArguments` object and returns a Promise that resolves to the response from the API.

The `Proxy` method takes an `ExplorerProvider` instance and returns a new instance that is a copy of the original instance, but with all properties set to read-only. This can be used to prevent the original instance from being modified. The `Remote` method takes an `ApiRequestHandler` function and returns a new `ExplorerProvider` instance that forwards all requests to the provided handler.\n\nOverall, this code provides a convenient and flexible way to interact with the Alephium blockchain explorer API in a TypeScript project.

For example, to fetch information about a specific block:\n\n```typescript\nimport { ExplorerProvider } from 'alephium-web3';\n\nconst explorer = new ExplorerProvider();\nconst blockInfo = await explorer.blocks.get('block-hash');\n```\n\nThe `node-provider.ts` file defines the `NodeProvider` class, which serves as a wrapper around the Alephium node API. This class exposes methods that correspond to various API endpoints, such as `wallets`, `infos`, `blockflow`, and more. For example, to fetch the balance of an address:\n\n```typescript\nimport { NodeProvider } from 'alephium-web3';\n\nconst node = new NodeProvider();\nconst balance = await node.addresses.getBalance('address');\n```\n\nThe `types.ts` file contains utility functions and type definitions for interacting with the Alephium blockchain through its web3 API. It defines several functions for converting between different data types used in the API and the corresponding JavaScript types, as well as functions for parsing API responses and converting them into JavaScript objects.\n\nThe `utils.ts` file contains utility functions for making HTTP requests to an API and handling rate limiting and retries. These functions are designed to be used in the larger Alephium project, which likely involves interacting with an external API. For example, to make a rate-limited fetch request:\n\n```typescript\nimport { throttledFetch, convertHttpResponse } from 'alephium-web3';\n\nconst fetch = throttledFetch(5); // limit to 5 requests per second\nconst response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');\nconst data = await convertHttpResponse(response);\nconsole.log(data);\n```\n\nThe `index.ts` file serves as a central point for exporting all the important modules and functions from the alephium-web3 project, making them easily accessible for use in other parts of the project or in external projects that depend on alephium-web3.\n\nOverall, the code in this folder provides a convenient and flexible way to interact with the Alephium blockchain through its web3 API, allowing developers to easily make requests to different API endpoints and handle responses in a type-safe manner.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/packages/web3/src/api/summary.md"}}],["102",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium-web3/packages/web3/src/api/types.ts)\n\nThis file contains utility functions and type definitions for interacting with the Alephium blockchain through its web3 API. The file defines several functions for converting between different data types used in the API and the corresponding JavaScript types. It also defines functions for parsing API responses and converting them into JavaScript objects.\n\nThe file defines several type aliases, including `Number256`, which represents a 256-bit integer, and `Val`, which represents a value that can be passed to or returned from an API call. The `NamedVals` type is a record of named `Val` values.\n\nThe `Token` interface represents a token on the Alephium blockchain, with an `id` string and an `amount` of `Number256` type. The file defines functions for converting between `Token` objects and the corresponding `node.Token` objects used in the API.\n\nThe file also defines functions for converting between JavaScript boolean values and the `Bool` type used in the API, as well as between JavaScript strings and the `ByteVec` and `Address` types used in the API.\n\nThe `toApiArray` function converts a JavaScript array to an `Array` type used in the API, with the specified base type and dimensions. The `fromApiArray` function converts an `Array` type from the API to a JavaScript array.\n\nThe `fromApiVals` function parses an array of `node.Val` objects returned from an API call, using the specified names and types to create a `NamedVals` object. The `fromApiVal` function converts a single `node.Val` object to a JavaScript value of the specified type.\n\nThe file also defines utility functions for forwarding API requests to a handler function, and for making API requests using a provider object and an `ApiRequestArguments` object.\n\nFinally, the file defines the `TokenMetaData` interface, which represents metadata for a token on the Alephium blockchain, including its name, symbol, decimals, and total supply.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this file in the alephium-web3 project?\n- This file contains utility functions for converting between different data types used in the project and the corresponding types used in the Alephium API.\n\n2.

The functions are designed to be used in the larger Alephium project, which likely involves interacting with an external API.\n\nThe `convertHttpResponse` function takes an HTTP response object and returns the data from the response. If the response contains an error, it throws an error with the error detail message.\n\nThe `retryFetch` function takes the same parameters as the built-in `fetch` function and attempts to make a request. If the response status is 429 (Too Many Requests), the function waits for a certain amount of time and retries the request up to a certain number of times. This is useful for handling rate limiting from the API. The function returns a promise that resolves to the response object.\n\nThe `throttledFetch` function takes a rate limit in requests per second and returns a custom `fetch` function that is rate-limited and retries requests as necessary. The function uses the `RateLimit` class from the `async-sema` library to limit the rate of requests. The returned function has the same parameters as the built-in `fetch` function and returns a promise that resolves to the response object.\n\nThe constants `RETRY_LIMIT_WHEN_429`, `DEFAULT_RATE_LIMIT`, and `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_FETCH` are also defined in this file. `RETRY_LIMIT_WHEN_429` is the maximum number of times `retryFetch` will retry a request when it receives a 429 response. `DEFAULT_RATE_LIMIT` is the default rate limit used by `throttledFetch`. `DEFAULT_THROTTLE_FETCH` is the default `fetch` function that is rate-limited and retries requests, with a rate limit of `DEFAULT_RATE_LIMIT` requests per second.\n\nOverall, these functions provide a convenient way to make HTTP requests to an API while handling rate limiting and retries. They can be used in the larger Alephium project to interact with an external API in a reliable and efficient manner. Here is an example of how `throttledFetch` might be used:\n\n```\nconst fetch = throttledFetch(5) // limit to 5 requests per second\nconst response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')\nconst data = await convertHttpResponse(response)\nconsole.log(data)\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The purpose of this code is to allow users to subscribe to events emitted by a smart contract on the Alephium blockchain. \n\nThe `EventSubscription` class extends a `Subscription` class and takes in a `SubscribeOptions` object and a contract address as parameters. It also has a `fromCount` property that keeps track of the number of events that have been processed so far. The `startPolling` method sets up an event listener that triggers the `polling` method to fetch new events.

These objects can be used for testing, validation, and understanding the structure of the Alephium blockchain, as well as for building user interfaces and backend systems that interact with the blockchain.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/packages/web3/src/fixtures/summary.md"}}],["112",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium-web3/packages/web3/src/fixtures/transaction.json)\n\nThe code provided is a JSON object that contains information about a transaction in the Alephium network. The transaction has two main stages: \"created\" and \"submitted\". \n\nIn the \"created\" stage, the transaction is unsigned and has a unique identifier represented by the \"unsignedTx\" field. Additionally, the transaction has a \"fromGroup\" and a \"toGroup\" field, which represent the source and destination groups of the transaction, respectively. These groups are used in the Alephium network to facilitate parallel processing of transactions and increase throughput.\n\nIn the \"submitted\" stage, the transaction has been signed and broadcasted to the network. The \"txId\" field represents the unique identifier of the transaction in this stage. Similar to the \"created\" stage, the transaction also has \"fromGroup\" and \"toGroup\" fields.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger Alephium project to track the status of transactions. For example, a user interface could display the \"created\" stage information to the user while waiting for the transaction to be signed and submitted. Once the transaction is submitted, the user interface could update to display the \"submitted\" stage information. Additionally, this code could be used in backend systems to monitor the progress of transactions and ensure they are being processed correctly.\n\nHere is an example of how this code could be used in JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nconst transaction = {\n  \"created\": {\n    \"unsignedTx\": \"0ecd20654c2e2be708495853e8da35c664247040c00bd10b9b13\",\n    \"txId\": \"798e9e137aec7c2d59d9655b4ffa640f301f628bf7c365083bb255f6aa5f89ef\",\n    \"fromGroup\": 2,\n    \"toGroup\": 1\n  },\n  \"submitted\": {\n    \"txId\": \"503bfb16230888af4924aa8f8250d7d348b862e267d75d3147f1998050b6da69\",\n    \"fromGroup\": 2,\n    \"toGroup\": 1\n  }\n};\n\n// Display the unsigned transaction ID to the user\nconsole.log(`Unsigned transaction ID: ${transaction.created.unsignedTx}`);\n\n// Wait for the transaction to be submitted and display the transaction ID\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  console.log(`Submitted transaction ID: ${transaction.submitted.txId}`);\n}, 5000);\n``` \n\nIn this example, the unsigned transaction ID is displayed to the user immediately, and then the code waits for 5 seconds before displaying the submitted transaction ID. This simulates the delay between the \"created\" and \"submitted\" stages of a transaction.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code represents a JSON object with information about a transaction that was created and submitted.\n\n2. What is the significance of the \"fromGroup\" and \"toGroup\" fields?\n- These fields indicate the source and destination groups of the transaction, which may be relevant for network routing or other purposes.\n\n3. What is the difference between the \"unsignedTx\" and \"txId\" fields?\n- The \"unsignedTx\" field represents the unsigned transaction data, while the \"txId\" field represents the unique identifier for the transaction after it has been signed and submitted.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/packages/web3/src/fixtures/transaction.md"}}],["113",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium-web3/packages/web3/src/fixtures/transactions.json)\n\nThis code represents a JSON object containing sample transaction data for the Alephium Web3 project.

These functions can be used by other modules to handle transaction signing and verification without having to implement the logic themselves.\n\nExample usage of `transactionSign`:\n\n```javascript\nimport { transactionSign } from 'alephium-web3'\n\nconst txId = '0x1234567890abcdef'\nconst privateKey = '0x0123456789abcdef'\nconst keyType = 'secp256k1'\n\nconst signature = transactionSign(txId, privateKey, keyType)\nconsole.log(signature)\n```\n\nExample usage of `transactionVerifySignature`:\n\n```javascript\nimport { transactionVerifySignature } from 'alephium-web3'\n\nconst txId = '0x1234567890abcdef'\nconst publicKey = '0x0123456789abcdef'\nconst signature = '0xabcdef0123456789'\nconst keyType = 'secp256k1'\n\nconst isValid = transactionVerifySignature(txId, publicKey, signature, keyType)\nconsole.log(isValid)\n```\n\n`status.ts` defines a `TxStatusSubscription` class and a `subscribeToTxStatus` function for subscribing to transaction status updates in the Alephium blockchain network. The `TxStatusSubscription` class extends the `Subscription` class and starts polling for transaction status updates as soon as it is created. The `subscribeToTxStatus` function is a wrapper around the `TxStatusSubscription` class constructor that creates and returns a new `TxStatusSubscription` instance with the given arguments.\n\nThis code is likely used in conjunction with other parts of the `alephium-web3` project to build decentralized applications on the Alephium network. For example, a developer might use the `subscribeToTxStatus` function to monitor the status of a transaction they have submitted to the network:\n\n```javascript\nimport { subscribeToTxStatus } from 'alephium-web3'\n\nconst txId = '0x1234567890abcdef'\nconst options = {\n  messageCallback: (status) => console.log('Status:', status),\n  errorCallback: (error) => console.error('Error:', error)\n}\n\nconst subscription = subscribeToTxStatus(options, txId)\n```\n\nIn this example, the developer creates a subscription to the transaction status updates for a specific transaction ID and provides callback functions for handling status updates and errors.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/packages/web3/src/transaction/summary.md"}}],["131",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium-web3/packages/web3/src/utils/address.ts)\n\nThis file contains a function called `addressToGroup` and two helper functions called `xorByte` and `toPosInt`. The purpose of this code is to take an Ethereum address and map it to a specific group number based on the total number of groups specified. This is useful for partitioning a large set of addresses into smaller groups for more efficient processing.\n\nThe `addressToGroup` function takes two arguments: the Ethereum address as a string and the total number of groups as a number. It first decodes the address using the `bs58` library and removes the first byte. It then passes the remaining bytes to the `djb2` function, which returns a hash value. This hash value is then passed to the `xorByte` function, which performs a bitwise XOR operation on the first three bytes and the original value, and returns the result. Finally, the `toPosInt` function is called on the XOR result to ensure that the value is a positive integer. This integer is then used to calculate the group number by taking the modulus of the total number of groups.\n\nFor example, if we have 1000 Ethereum addresses and we want to partition them into 10 groups, we can use this function to map each address to a group number between 0 and 9. This can be useful for parallel processing or load balancing, as each group can be processed independently.\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple and efficient way to map Ethereum addresses to group numbers based on a hash function and XOR operation.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n- This code is a function that takes an address and a total number of groups as input, and returns a number representing the group to which the address belongs. It does this by decoding the address using base58 encoding, hashing the resulting bytes using the djb2 algorithm, and then performing some bitwise operations to determine the group.\n\n2. What are the dependencies of this code?\n- This code has two dependencies, which are imported at the top of the file: `bs58` and `djb2`. `bs58` is a library for encoding and decoding base58 strings, and `djb2` is a hash function that takes an array of bytes as input and returns a hash value.\n\n3.

Base58 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that is commonly used in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The purpose of this code is to provide a library for encoding and decoding data using the Base58 algorithm.\n\nThe code imports the `base-x` library, which is a JavaScript library for encoding and decoding data using custom alphabets. The `ALPHABET` constant is defined as a string of characters that are used in the Base58 encoding scheme. The `bs58` constant is then defined as a new instance of the `basex` function, which is initialized with the `ALPHABET` constant.\n\nThe `isBase58` function is defined to check whether a given string is a valid Base58-encoded string. It first checks if the string is empty or contains only whitespace characters, and returns `false` if it is. It then attempts to decode the string using the `bs58` constant, and encodes the decoded data using `bs58` again. If the resulting string is equal to the original input string, then the input string is a valid Base58-encoded string and the function returns `true`. Otherwise, the function returns `false`.\n\nFinally, the `bs58` constant is exported as the default export of the module. This allows other modules to import the `bs58` constant and use it for encoding and decoding data using the Base58 algorithm.\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple and efficient implementation of Base58 encoding and decoding, which can be used in various parts of the larger project.

What license is this code released under?\n   - This code is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later, as well as the MIT License.\n3. What is the significance of the `ALPHABET` constant and why was it chosen?\n   - The `ALPHABET` constant defines the characters used in the Base58 encoding scheme, and it was chosen to exclude characters that can be easily confused with each other (such as 0/O and l/1), as well as to avoid characters that may be problematic in certain contexts (such as + and / in URLs).","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/packages/web3/src/utils/bs58.md"}}],["133",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium-web3/packages/web3/src/utils/djb2.ts)\n\nThe code provided is a JavaScript function called `djb2` that exports a hash function. The purpose of this function is to generate a hash value for a given input `Uint8Array` of bytes. The hash function uses the djb2 algorithm, which is a simple non-cryptographic hash function that is commonly used in hash tables.\n\nThe function takes in a single parameter, `bytes`, which is an array of unsigned 8-bit integers. The function iterates through each byte in the array and performs a series of bitwise operations to generate a hash value. The hash value is initialized to 5381 and then updated for each byte in the array using the following formula:\n\n```\nhash = (hash << 5) + hash + (bytes[i] & 0xff)\n```\n\nThe `<<` operator is a bitwise left shift, which shifts the bits of the `hash` value to the left by 5 positions. The `+` operator adds the original `hash` value to the shifted value. Finally, the bitwise AND operator `&` is used to mask the least significant 8 bits of the `bytes[i]` value, ensuring that only the first 8 bits are used in the calculation.\n\nOnce the function has iterated through all the bytes in the input array, it returns the resulting hash value as a 32-bit integer.\n\nThis function can be used in the larger project to generate hash values for various purposes, such as indexing data in a hash table or verifying the integrity of data. For example, if the project involves storing data in a hash table, this function can be used to generate a hash value for each piece of data, which can then be used to determine the index in the hash table where the data should be stored. Similarly, if the project involves verifying the integrity of data, this function can be used to generate a hash value for the original data and then compare it to the hash value of the received data to ensure that it has not been tampered with.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport djb2 from 'alephium-web3'\n\nconst data = new Uint8Array([0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04])\nconst hash = djb2(data)\nconsole.log(hash) // Output: 1437863053\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

The component takes two props: `children` and `icon`. The `children` prop is used to pass in the content of the alert, while the `icon` prop is used to pass in an optional icon to be displayed alongside the content.\n\nThe `Alert` component is defined using the `React.forwardRef` function, which allows the component to forward a ref to one of its children. This is useful when the component needs to access the DOM node of one of its children, for example to set focus or measure its size.\n\nThe `Alert` component renders a container element with the class `AlertContainer`, which is defined in a separate file. If the `icon` prop is provided, the component also renders an `IconContainer` element with the `icon` prop as its child. Finally, the component renders a `div` element with the `children` prop as its content.\n\nThe `Alert` component is exported as the default export of the module, which means that it can be imported and used in other parts of the project. For example, a parent component could use the `Alert` component to display an error message to the user:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport Alert from 'alephium-web3/Alert'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [error, setError] = React.useState(null)\n\n  function handleButtonClick() {\n    try {\n      // some code that might throw an error\n    } catch (error) {\n      setError(error.message)\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Do something risky</button>\n      {error && <Alert>{error}</Alert>}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MyComponent` function defines a state variable `error` that is initially set to `null`. When the user clicks the button, the component tries to execute some code that might throw an error. If an error is thrown, the component catches it and sets the `error` state variable to the error message.

This type is used in components that display alerts or notifications to the user, ensuring consistent props and easy maintenance and updates.\n\nHere's an example of how the `Alert` component can be used in a parent component:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport Alert from 'alephium-web3/Alert'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [error, setError] = React.useState(null)\n\n  function handleButtonClick() {\n    try {\n      // some code that might throw an error\n    } catch (error) {\n      setError(error.message)\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Do something risky</button>\n      {error && <Alert>{error}</Alert>}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MyComponent` function defines a state variable `error` that is initially set to `null`. When the user clicks the button, the component tries to execute some code that might throw an error. If an error is thrown, the component catches it and sets the `error` state variable to the error message. Finally, the component renders an `Alert` component with the `error` message as its content, which is displayed to the user.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/packages/web3-react/src/components/Common/Alert/summary.md"}}],["153",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium-web3/packages/web3-react/src/components/Common/Alert/types.ts)\n\nThis code defines a TypeScript type called `AlertProps` that is exported for use in other parts of the Alephium project. The `AlertProps` type is an object that can have two properties: `children` and `icon`. The `children` property is of type `React.ReactNode`, which means it can accept any valid React node as its value. The `icon` property is also of type `React.ReactNode`, which means it can accept any valid React node as its value.\n\nThis type is likely used in components that display alerts or notifications to the user. By defining this type, the Alephium project can ensure that any components that use alerts or notifications have consistent props and can be easily maintained and updated.\n\nHere is an example of how this type might be used in a React component:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { AlertProps } from 'alephium-web3';\n\nconst Alert: React.FC<AlertProps> = ({ children, icon }) => {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"alert\">\n      {icon && <div className=\"alert-icon\">{icon}</div>}\n      <div className=\"alert-content\">{children}</div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Alert;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Alert` component accepts `AlertProps` as its props and uses the `children` and `icon` properties to render an alert. The `icon` property is optional, so it only renders if it is provided. This component can be used throughout the Alephium project to display alerts and notifications with consistent props.\n## Questions: \n 1.

What license is this project using?\n- The project is using the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3 or later.\n\n3. What is the expected format for the children and icon props in AlertProps?\n- The children prop should be a React node, and the icon prop should also be a React node.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/packages/web3-react/src/components/Common/Alert/types.md"}}],["154",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium-web3/packages/web3-react/src/components/Common/BrowserIcon/index.tsx)\n\nThis code defines a React component called `BrowserIcon` that renders an icon for a web browser. The component takes a `browser` prop that specifies which browser to render an icon for. If the `browser` prop is not provided, the component will attempt to detect the current browser using the `detectBrowser` utility function from the `utils` module.\n\nThe `detectBrowser` function is not defined in this file, but it is likely a utility function that uses the `window.navigator.userAgent` property to determine the current browser. The `detectBrowser` function is imported from the `utils` module, which suggests that this component is part of a larger web application.\n\nThe `browsers` object is imported from the `assets/browsers` module, which contains SVG icons for each supported browser. The `BrowserIcon` component uses a `switch` statement to select the appropriate icon based on the `currentBrowser` value. If the `currentBrowser` value is not one of the supported browsers, the component returns an empty fragment.\n\nThe `BrowserIcon` component is a functional component that uses the `React.forwardRef` function to forward a ref to the underlying DOM element. The component renders the selected icon inside a `BrowserIconContainer` component, which is defined in the `styles` module.\n\nThe `BrowserIcon` component is exported as the default export of the module, which means that it can be imported and used in other modules. The `displayName` property is set to `'BrowserIcon'`, which is used by React for debugging purposes.\n\nOverall, this code defines a reusable React component that renders an icon for a web browser based on the `browser` prop or the current browser detected by the `detectBrowser` utility function. The component is likely used in a larger web application to provide browser-specific functionality or styling.\n## Questions: \n 1.

It is designed to be used in different parts of the project with different content and actions.\n\nThe `Modal` component accepts several props, including `open`, `pages`, `pageId`, `positionInside`, `inline`, `onClose`, `onBack`, and `onInfo`. These props control the modal's visibility, content, positioning, and event handlers for closing, going back, and showing more information.\n\nThe `Page` component is used to render each page within the modal, and it handles the transition states and animations for entering and exiting the page. The `OrDivider` component is a simple styled divider with a customizable text, typically used to separate different sections or actions within the modal.\n\nThe `Modal` component uses the `AnimatePresence` and `motion` components from the `framer-motion` library to handle animations and transitions. It also uses custom hooks like `useTransition`, `useFocusTrap`, and `usePrevious` to manage the modal's state, focus management, and previous values.\n\nHere's an example of how the `Modal` component can be used:\n\n```jsx\nimport Modal, { routes, OrDivider } from './Modal';\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const [modalOpen, setModalOpen] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleModalClose = () => {\n    setModalOpen(false);\n  };\n\n  const pages = [\n    {\n      id: routes.CONNECTORS,\n      content: <div>Connectors Content</div>,\n    },\n    {\n      id: routes.PROFILE,\n      content: <div>Profile Content</div>,\n    },\n  ];\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => setModalOpen(true)}>Open Modal</button>\n      <Modal\n        open={modalOpen}\n        pages={pages}\n        pageId={routes.CONNECTORS}\n        onClose={handleModalClose}\n      />\n    </>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, a button is used to open the modal, and the `handleModalClose` function is passed as the `onClose` prop to close the modal.

These keys represent different pages or views within the application. The `Modal` component takes a `pageId` prop, which is used to determine the currently active page and render its content accordingly.\n\n3. **How does the `Modal` component handle transitions between pages?**\n\n   The `Modal` component uses the `useTransition` hook from the `react-transition-state` library to manage transitions between pages. It also uses the `AnimatePresence` and `motion` components from the `framer-motion` library to handle animations and transitions for various elements within the component.

It sets the display to flex, aligns items to the center, and justifies content to the start. It also sets the position to relative, height to 40px, padding to 0, line-height to 0, letter-spacing to -0.2px, font-size to 16px, and font-weight to 500. It also sets the text-align to center and applies a transition effect to color, background, box-shadow, and border-radius. \n\nThe `Container` component has two variants, `primary` and `secondary`. The `primary` variant sets the `--color`, `--background`, `--box-shadow`, and `--border-radius` CSS variables to specific values. It also sets the `--hover-color`, `--hover-background`, `--hover-box-shadow`, and `--hover-border-radius` CSS variables to specific values for when the button is hovered over. Similarly, it sets the `--active-color`, `--active-background`, `--active-box-shadow`, and `--active-border-radius` CSS variables to specific values for when the button is clicked. \n\nThe `secondary` variant is similar to the `primary` variant, but it sets different CSS variables for the button's color, background, box-shadow, and border-radius. \n\nThe `ThemeContainer` component is a styled button that sets all CSS properties to initial values and sets the appearance to none. It also sets the user-select to none, position to relative, padding to 0, margin to 0, and background to none. It sets the border-radius to a CSS variable `--ck-border-radius`. \n\nThe `ThemeContainer` component has a `disabled` state that sets the pointer-events to none and opacity to 0.3. \n\nThe `ThemeContainer` component also has a hover state that changes the color, background, box-shadow, and border-radius of the `Container` component when the button is hovered over. Similarly, it has an active state that changes these properties when the button is clicked. \n\nThese styled components can be used to create buttons with different styles throughout the Alephium Web3 project.

It has two variants, `primary` and `secondary`, each with different color, background, box-shadow, and border-radius properties.\n\nThe `ThemeContainer` component is a styled button that sets all CSS properties to initial values and applies additional styling, such as user-select, position, padding, margin, and background. It also has a `disabled` state and hover and active states that change the appearance of the `Container` component when the button is hovered over or clicked.\n\nThese styled components can be used to create buttons with different styles throughout the Alephium Web3 project. For example, a button with the `primary` variant can be used for primary actions, while a button with the `secondary` variant can be used for secondary actions. The `ThemeContainer` component can be used to wrap any content that needs to be styled as a button.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/packages/web3-react/src/components/Common/ThemedButton/summary.md"}}],["175",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium-web3/packages/web3-react/src/components/Common/Tooltip/index.tsx)\n\nThis code defines a React component called `Tooltip` that renders a tooltip window with a message when the user hovers over or clicks on a target element. The tooltip is positioned relative to the target element and can be customized with an offset and a delay. The component uses the `useAlephiumConnectContext` hook to access the current route, theme, and mode of the Alephium Connect app.\n\nThe `Tooltip` component uses several React hooks to manage its state and layout. The `useState` hook is used to manage the `isOpen` state of the tooltip window, which is initially set to `false`. The `useMeasure` hook is used to measure the size and position of the target element and the tooltip window. The `useLayoutEffect` hook is used to update the layout of the tooltip window when the target element or the `isOpen` state changes. The `useEffect` hook is used to update the `isOpen` state when the `open` prop or the `context.open` state changes.\n\nThe `Tooltip` component uses the `motion` component from the `framer-motion` library to animate the opening and closing of the tooltip window. The `Portal` component is used to render the tooltip window outside the current React tree, which allows it to be positioned relative to the target element even if the target element is inside a container with a `overflow: hidden` style.\n\nThe `Tooltip` component exports a default function that takes several props:\n\n- `children`: the target element that triggers the tooltip window\n- `message`: the message to display in the tooltip window\n- `open`: a boolean that controls the visibility of the tooltip window\n- `xOffset`: the horizontal offset of the tooltip window relative to the target element\n- `yOffset`: the vertical offset of the tooltip window relative to the target element\n- `delay`: the delay before the tooltip window opens, in seconds\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `Tooltip` component:\n\n```jsx\nimport Tooltip from 'alephium-web3/components/Tooltip'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <Tooltip message=\"Hello, world!\" xOffset={10} yOffset={-10}>\n      <button>Hover me</button>\n    </Tooltip>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThis will render a button that displays a tooltip window with the message \"Hello, world!\" when the user hovers over it. The tooltip window will be positioned 10 pixels to the right and 10 pixels above the button.\n## Questions: \n 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the Alephium project?\n- This code is a React component for rendering tooltips and is used in the Alephium project for displaying information to users when they hover over certain elements.\n\n2. What are the dependencies of this code and what do they do?\n- This code has dependencies on the `react`, `react-use-measure`, `framer-motion`, and `alephiumConnect` packages. `react` is the core library for building the UI, `react-use-measure` is used for measuring the size and position of elements, `framer-motion` is used for animating the tooltip, and `alephiumConnect` is a custom context used for managing the state of the Alephium wallet.\n\n3. What are the conditions under which the tooltip is displayed and how is it positioned?\n- The tooltip is displayed when the user hovers over the element or when the `open` prop is set to `true`. The tooltip is positioned relative to the element being hovered over, with an optional offset specified by the `xOffset` and `yOffset` props. The code also checks if the tooltip is out of bounds of the viewport and adjusts its position accordingly.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/packages/web3-react/src/components/Common/Tooltip/index.md"}}],["176",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium-web3/packages/web3-react/src/components/Common/Tooltip/styles.ts)\n\nThis file contains styled components for a tooltip window that can be used in the Alephium web3 project. The tooltip window is a UI element that displays additional information when the user hovers over a specific element on the page. \n\nThe `TooltipWindow` component is a fixed-position element that covers the entire viewport and has a high z-index to ensure it appears above all other elements on the page. It has `pointer-events: none` to allow mouse events to pass through to the underlying elements. \n\nThe `TooltipContainer` component is the actual tooltip that appears when the user hovers over an element. It is an absolutely positioned element that is centered on the hovered element and has a border, padding, and background color to distinguish it from the rest of the page. It also has a shadow and a tail that points to the hovered element. The size of the tooltip can be customized using the `$size` prop, which is of type `TooltipSizeProps`. \n\nThe `TooltipTail` component is the tail of the tooltip that points to the hovered element. It is an absolutely positioned element that is centered on the right edge of the tooltip and has a triangular shape. The size of the tail can also be customized using the `$size` prop. \n\nThese components are styled using CSS variables that are defined elsewhere in the project. The `styled` function is imported from the `styled-components` library, which allows for easy creation of reusable styled components. \n\nOverall, these components provide a customizable and visually appealing tooltip window that can be used throughout the Alephium web3 project to enhance the user experience.

The purpose of this component is to connect to a desktop wallet for the Alephium blockchain. The component imports several dependencies, including `React`, `useEffect`, and `useState`. It also imports two custom hooks, `useAlephiumConnectContext` and `useConnect`, from the `alephiumConnect` and `hooks` directories, respectively.\n\nThe `useAlephiumConnectContext` hook provides access to the Alephium Connect context, which contains information about the user's wallet, such as the address group, key type, and network ID. The `useConnect` hook is used to initiate the connection to the desktop wallet. It takes an object with the address group, key type, and network ID as arguments.\n\nThe `ConnectWithDesktopWallet` component uses the `useState` hook to define a state variable called `error`, which is initially set to `undefined`. The `useEffect` hook is used to call the `connect` function from the `useConnect` hook when the component mounts. If an error occurs during the connection process, the `setError` function is called to update the `error` state variable with the error message.\n\nFinally, the component returns a `PageContent` component with a `Container` component inside. The `Container` component displays either the `error` message or the text \"Opening desktop wallet...\" depending on whether an error occurred during the connection process.\n\nThis component is likely used in a larger project that involves interacting with the Alephium blockchain.

It is used to indicate that a process is running or loading, such as when connecting to a server or fetching data. \n\nThe component takes in several props, including `logo`, `smallLogo`, `connecting`, `unavailable`, and `countdown`. The `logo` prop is used to pass in a custom logo to be displayed in the center of the spinner. The `smallLogo` prop is a boolean that determines whether the logo should be smaller. The `connecting` prop is a boolean that determines whether the spinner should be displayed. The `unavailable` prop is a boolean that determines whether the spinner should have a rounded border or not. The `countdown` prop is a boolean that determines whether the spinner should have a countdown animation.\n\nThe spinner animation is created using SVG and Framer Motion. The spinner consists of a circular path that is animated to rotate around the center of the spinner. The `AnimatePresence` component is used to animate the spinner in and out of the DOM. When the `connecting` prop is true, the spinner is displayed with a fade-in animation. When the `countdown` prop is true, the spinner is displayed with a countdown animation that fades out after a short duration.\n\nThe `CircleSpinner` component is used throughout the Alephium Web3 project to indicate loading or connecting states. It can be used in conjunction with other components to create a more complex loading or connecting UI. For example, it can be used in a modal or overlay to indicate that a process is running in the background. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport CircleSpinner from 'alephium-web3/components/CircleSpinner'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <CircleSpinner connecting />\n      <p>Loading...</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n## Questions: \n 1.

It is a React component that renders a circular spinner animation with an optional logo. The component accepts several props, such as `logo`, `smallLogo`, `connecting`, `unavailable`, and `countdown`, which allow customization of the spinner's appearance and behavior.\n\nThe spinner animation is created using SVG and Framer Motion, with the `AnimatePresence` component animating the spinner in and out of the DOM. Depending on the provided props, the spinner can have different animations, such as a fade-in animation when `connecting` is true or a countdown animation when `countdown` is true.\n\nIn the `styles.ts` file, you'll find styled components for the logo and spinner, which define the appearance of these elements. The `LogoContainer` component acts as a wrapper for the logo and spinner components, while the `ExpiringSpinner` and `Spinner` components represent different spinner animations.\n\nThe `CircleSpinner` component can be used in various parts of the Alephium Web3 project to indicate loading or connecting states. For instance, it can be combined with other components to create a more complex loading or connecting UI, such as in a modal or overlay to indicate a background process.\n\nHere's an example of how the `CircleSpinner` component might be used:\n\n```jsx\nimport CircleSpinner from 'alephium-web3/components/CircleSpinner'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <CircleSpinner connecting />\n      <p>Loading...</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `CircleSpinner` component is used alongside a paragraph element to display a loading message.

The component handles various connection states, such as connecting, connected, expiring, failed, rejected, not connected, and unavailable.\n\nThe component accepts three props: `connectorId`, `switchConnectMethod`, and `forceState`. The `connectorId` is used to identify the specific browser extension to connect with. The `switchConnectMethod` function is called when the user wants to switch to a different connection method, such as scanning a QR code. The optional `forceState` prop can be used to force the component into a specific state for testing purposes.\n\nThe component uses the `useAlephiumConnectContext` and `useConnect` hooks to manage the connection with the Alephium wallet. It also uses the `supportedConnectors` constant to filter the list of supported connectors based on the provided `connectorId`.\n\nThe component renders different content based on the current connection state. For example, when the state is `connecting`, it displays a spinner animation with the logo of the selected connector. If the state is `failed` or `rejected`, it shows an error message and a retry button. If the state is `unavailable`, it suggests installing the required browser extension.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `ConnectWithInjector` component:\n\n```jsx\n<ConnectWithInjector\n  connectorId=\"metamask\"\n  switchConnectMethod={switchConnectMethod}\n/>\n```\n\nThis will render the component with the MetaMask connector and handle the connection process accordingly.\n## Questions: \n 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `ConnectWithInjector` component and how does it work with different connector states?\n   **Answer:** The `ConnectWithInjector` component is responsible for handling the connection process with different wallet connectors. It manages various states like connecting, connected, expiring, failed, rejected, not connected, and unavailable, and updates the UI accordingly based on the current state.\n\n2. **Question:** How does the `runConnect` function work and when is it called?\n   **Answer:** The `runConnect` function is responsible for initiating the connection process with the wallet connector. It checks if the extension is installed and then calls the `connect` function from the `useConnect` hook. If the connection is successful, it updates the status to connected and closes the context. The function is called within a `useEffect` hook with a 600ms timeout to give the user time to see the UI before opening the extension.\n\n3. **Question:** How does the code handle the countdown timer for the expiring state?\n   **Answer:** The code has a commented-out section for handling the countdown timer for the expiring state. It initializes the `expiryTimer` state with a default value of 9 and uses a `useEffect` hook to update the timer. However, the timer functionality is currently not being used, and the countdown timer is not displayed in the UI.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/packages/web3-react/src/components/ConnectModal/ConnectWithInjector/index.md"}}],["189",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium-web3/packages/web3-react/src/components/ConnectModal/ConnectWithInjector/styles.ts)\n\nThis file contains styled components for a loading spinner and retry button that are used in the Alephium web3 project. The `Content` component is a container for the modal content and has a flexbox layout with a vertical column direction and a gap of 6px between its child elements. It also has a relative position and spans the full width of its parent container. The `Container` component is a container for the loading spinner and has a motion animation applied to it. The `ConnectingContainer` component is a container for the loading spinner and has a fixed height of 120px and is centered horizontally and vertically within its parent container. The `ConnectingAnimation` component is the actual loading spinner and has two animation keyframes applied to it: `shakeKeyframes` and `outlineKeyframes`. The `shakeKeyframes` animation causes the spinner to shake back and forth horizontally, while the `outlineKeyframes` animation causes a red outline to appear around the spinner and then fade out. The `RetryButton` component is a button that appears when there is an error and allows the user to retry the action. It has a fixed position in the bottom right corner of its parent container and has a circular shape with a 32px diameter. The `RetryIconContainer` component is a container for the retry button icon and has a conic gradient applied to it. \n\nThese components are used throughout the Alephium web3 project to provide visual feedback to the user during loading and error states. For example, the `ConnectingContainer` component may be used when the user is waiting for a transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain, while the `RetryButton` component may be used when there is an error fetching data from a remote server.

The use of styled components allows for easy customization of the appearance of these buttons, ensuring a consistent user interface across different parts of the application.\n\nHere's an example of how these components might be used:\n\n```javascript\nimport { ConnectorsContainer, ConnectorButton } from 'alephium-web3'\n\nfunction ConnectorList() {\n  return (\n    <ConnectorsContainer>\n      <ConnectorButton>\n        <ConnectorLabel>Ethereum</ConnectorLabel>\n        <ConnectorIcon><EthereumIcon /></ConnectorIcon>\n      </ConnectorButton>\n      <ConnectorButton>\n        <ConnectorLabel>Binance Smart Chain</ConnectorLabel>\n        <ConnectorIcon><BinanceIcon /></ConnectorIcon>\n      </ConnectorButton>\n      <ConnectorButton>\n        <ConnectorLabel>Polkadot</ConnectorLabel>\n        <ConnectorIcon><PolkadotIcon /></ConnectorIcon>\n      </ConnectorButton>\n    </ConnectorsContainer>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ConnectorList` function renders a `ConnectorsContainer` component containing three `ConnectorButton` components for Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polkadot networks. Each button includes a label and an icon, and when clicked, initiates a connection to the corresponding network.\n\nIn summary, the code in the `Connectors` folder provides a simple and intuitive way for users to connect their wallets to the Alephium network. By rendering a list of supported wallet connectors and allowing users to select the one they want to use, the `Connectors` component makes it easy for users to get started with the Alephium network. The styled components in `styles.ts` ensure a consistent and customizable user interface, which is essential for a seamless user experience.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/packages/web3-react/src/components/Pages/Connectors/summary.md"}}],["197",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium-web3/packages/web3-react/src/components/Pages/Profile/index.tsx)\n\nThis code defines a React functional component called `Profile` that displays the user's account information and balance.

These modules contain type definitions and classes that are used to interact with the Alephium network and to define the types of the properties in the `AlephiumConnectContext` object.\n\nHere is an example of how the `useAlephiumConnectContext` hook can be used in a component:\n\n```javascript\nimport { useAlephiumConnectContext } from './path/to/AlephiumConnectContext'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const { account, setAccount } = useAlephiumConnectContext()\n\n  const handleConnect = async () => {\n    // Connect to wallet and set account\n    const account = await connectToWallet()\n    setAccount(account)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {account ? (\n        <p>Connected to {account.address}</p>\n      ) : (\n        <button onClick={handleConnect}>Connect to Wallet</button>\n      )}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `useAlephiumConnectContext` hook is used to access the `account` and `setAccount` properties from the `AlephiumConnectContext`. The `handleConnect` function is used to connect to the user's wallet and set the `account` property in the context. The component renders a button to connect to the wallet if the `account` property is not set, and displays the connected account address if the `account` property is set.\n\nOverall, the code in this file provides the context and hook necessary to manage the state of the Alephium Connect feature in a React application. It can be used to connect a user's wallet to the Alephium network and to perform transactions on the network.","metadata":{"source":".autodoc/docs/markdown/packages/web3-react/src/contexts/summary.md"}}],["207",{"pageContent":"[View code on GitHub](https://github.com/alephium/alephium-web3/.autodoc/docs/json/packages/web3-react/src/hooks)\n\nThe `hooks` folder in the `alephium-web3` project contains custom React hooks that provide various functionalities related to the Alephium blockchain.

The function takes an options object as an argument, which can include the following properties:\n\n- `logLevel`: A string that specifies the level of logging to use. The default value is `'info'`.\n- `maxFontSize`: A number that specifies the maximum font size to use. The default value is `100`.\n- `minFontSize`: A number that specifies the minimum font size to use.

The default value is `5`.\n\nThe function returns an object that contains the `fontSize` and `ref` properties. The `fontSize` property is a number that represents the font size that was used to fit the text. The `ref` property is a reference to the container element that the text is contained within.\n\nThe `useFitText` function uses a `ResizeObserver` to monitor changes to the size of the container element. When the size changes, the function recalculates the font size to fit the text. The function uses a binary search algorithm to adjust the font size until the text fits within the container. The `useIsoLayoutEffect` hook is used to suppress warnings when rendering on the server.\n\nThe `useFitText` function can be used in a larger project to dynamically adjust the font size of text to fit within a container.

The purpose of this component is to ensure that when a user interacts with a specific part of a web page, such as a modal dialog or a dropdown menu, they cannot accidentally tab out of that element and move focus to another part of the page. This can be especially important for users who rely on keyboard navigation to interact with web content.\n\nThe `FocusTrap` component uses a custom hook called `useFocusTrap` to manage focus trapping behavior. The `useFocusTrap` hook takes no arguments and returns a `ref` object that can be attached to a DOM element. When the `FocusTrap` component is mounted, it calls the `useFocusTrap` hook to get a `ref` to the element it should trap focus within. It then attaches an event listener to that element that listens for the `Tab` key. When the `Tab` key is pressed, the event listener checks whether the currently focused element is the first or last focusable element within the trapped element. If it is, focus is moved to the opposite end of the trapped element, effectively trapping focus within that element.\n\nThe `FocusTrap` component itself is a simple wrapper around the trapped element. It takes a single prop called `children`, which should be the content that should be trapped. When the `FocusTrap` component is mounted, it attaches the `ref` returned by `useFocusTrap` to a `div` element that wraps the `children`. This `div` element is given a `tabIndex` of `0`, which makes it focusable. When the `div` element receives focus, focus is automatically moved to the first focusable element within the trapped element.\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple way to ensure that users cannot accidentally tab out of a specific part of a web page. By wrapping content in a `FocusTrap` component, developers can ensure that users can only interact with that content until they explicitly close or dismiss it.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The purpose of this hook is to determine whether a component is currently mounted or not. \n\nThe hook uses the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks from the React library. The `useState` hook initializes a state variable called `mounted` to `false`. The `useEffect` hook is used to update the `mounted` state variable to `true` when the component is mounted. The second argument to `useEffect` is an empty array, which means that the effect will only run once when the component is mounted.\n\nThe `useIsMounted` hook returns the `mounted` state variable, which will be `true` if the component is mounted and `false` otherwise. This can be useful in situations where you need to conditionally render content based on whether a component is mounted or not. For example, you might want to fetch data from an API when a component is mounted, but not when it is unmounted. You could use the `useIsMounted` hook to conditionally fetch the data only when the component is mounted.\n\nHere is an example of how you might use the `useIsMounted` hook in a component:\n\n```\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport useIsMounted from './useIsMounted'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const isMounted = useIsMounted()\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (isMounted) {\n      // Fetch data from API\n    }\n  }, [isMounted])\n\n  return (\n    // Render component\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `useEffect` hook will only fetch data from the API if the component is currently mounted. The `isMounted` variable is passed as a dependency to the `useEffect` hook to ensure that the effect only runs when the `isMounted` value changes.\n## Questions: \n 1.

This hook is part of the Alephium project and is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\nThe `usePrevious` hook takes two arguments: `value` and `initial`. The `value` argument is the current value of the variable that the developer wants to track, while the `initial` argument is an optional initial value that will be returned if there is no previous value.\n\nThe hook uses the `useRef` and `useEffect` hooks from React to store and update the previous value of the variable. The `useRef` hook creates a mutable object that persists for the lifetime of the component, while the `useEffect` hook is used to update the previous value when the `value` argument changes.\n\nThe `usePrevious` hook works by comparing the current `value` argument to the previous `target` value stored in the `ref` object. If the `value` argument has changed, the hook updates the `previous` value to the previous `target` value and updates the `target` value to the new `value` argument.\n\nThis hook can be useful in scenarios where developers need to track changes to a variable and perform some action based on the previous value. For example, if a developer is building a form and wants to show an error message when a user changes a field value, they can use the `usePrevious` hook to compare the current and previous values of the field and show the error message if the values are different.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the `usePrevious` hook:\n\n```\nimport React, { useState } from 'react'\nimport usePrevious from './usePrevious'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n  const previousCount = usePrevious(count)\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Current count: {count}</p>\n      <p>Previous count: {previousCount}</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `usePrevious` hook is used to track changes to the `count` variable and display the current and previous values of the variable. When the user clicks the \"Increment\" button, the `count` variable is updated and the `usePrevious` hook updates the `previousCount` variable to the previous value of `count`.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The `web3.setCurrentNodeProvider` function is then called to set the node provider to the one provided by the Alephium wallet.\n\nThe hook then creates a subscription to the transaction status using the `subscribeToTxStatus` function from the `@alephium/web3` library. The subscription options are defined in the `subscriptionOptions` object, which includes a polling interval of 3 seconds, a message callback function that updates the transaction status and calls the provided callback function, and an error callback function that logs any errors and unsubscribes from the subscription.\n\nThe hook returns the current transaction status as a state variable, which can be used to render the component based on the current status of the transaction. \n\nHere is an example of how the hook can be used in a React component:\n\n```\nimport { useTxStatus } from './useTxStatus'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const { txStatus } = useTxStatus('0x123456789abcdef')\n\n  if (txStatus === undefined) {\n    return <div>Loading...</div>\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Transaction status: {txStatus.type}</p>\n      <p>Transaction hash: {txStatus.hash}</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `useTxStatus` hook is called with a transaction ID of `0x123456789abcdef`.

It exports an object called `defaultTheme` which contains a `connectKit` property. The `connectKit` property is an object that contains an `options` property and a `theme` property. The `options` property is an object that contains a single property called `iconStyle` which is set to `'light'`. The `theme` property is an object that contains three properties: `preferred`, `light`, and `dark`. The `preferred` property is set to `'dark'`, indicating that the preferred theme for the project is a dark theme. The `light` and `dark` properties are both set to the same default light theme object.\n\nThe default light theme object contains properties for various UI elements such as fonts, text colors, buttons, navigation, modals, tooltips, and QR codes. Each property contains a set of values that define the appearance of the corresponding UI element. For example, the `font` property contains a `family` property that defines the font family used for text. The `text` property contains properties for primary and secondary text colors, as well as colors for error and valid states. The `buttons` property contains properties for primary and secondary button styles, including colors for text, background, and border, as well as hover states. The `navigation`, `modal`, `tooltips`, and `qrCode` properties contain similar sets of values for their respective UI elements.\n\nThe `parseTheme` function is defined but not used in this code. It takes a theme object as input and returns the same object, but with its values parsed into CSS variables.\n\nThe `userPrefersDarkMode` function checks whether the user's device is set to prefer a dark color scheme. If the function is called in a non-browser environment, it returns `false`. Otherwise, it checks whether the `window` object has a `matchMedia` method and whether the device prefers a dark color scheme. If the device does prefer a dark color scheme, the `darkMode` variable is set to `true`.\n\nOverall, this code defines the default theme for the Alephium web3 project and provides a way to check whether the user's device prefers a dark color scheme. The `defaultTheme` object can be used throughout the project to provide a consistent appearance for UI elements. The `userPrefersDarkMode` function can be used to determine whether to use a dark or light theme by default, depending on the user's device settings.\n## Questions: \n 1.

The purpose of this code is to provide a way to create custom styled components that can be used throughout the larger project. \n\nThe `styled-components` library allows developers to create reusable UI components with custom styles using a CSS-in-JS approach. This means that styles are defined in JavaScript code rather than in separate CSS files. This approach offers several benefits, including better encapsulation, easier theming, and improved performance.\n\nThe code checks if the `styled.div` function is available, and if it is, exports the `styled` object. If the `styled.div` function is not available, it exports the `default` property of the `styled` object. This ensures that the code works with different versions of the `styled-components` library.\n\nHere is an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:\n\n```jsx\nimport styled from 'alephium-web3'\n\nconst Button = styled.button`\n  background-color: blue;\n  color: white;\n  padding: 10px;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n`\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Button>Click me</Button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, a custom `Button` component is created using the `styled` function exported by this code.

These functions are primarily focused on detecting the user's browser, operating system, and device type, as well as providing helper functions for rendering React components and Ethereum addresses.\n\nFor example, the `detectBrowser` function uses the `detect-browser` library to identify the user's browser. This information can be used to optimize the application's performance or display for specific browsers. Similarly, the `detectOS` function identifies the user's operating system, which can be useful for tailoring the application's behavior or appearance to different platforms.\n\n```typescript\nconst browserName = detectBrowser();\nconst osName = detectOS();\n```\n\nThe `isIOS`, `isAndroid`, and `isMobile` functions build upon the `detectOS` function to determine if the user is on an iOS, Android, or any mobile device. This information can be used to provide a more tailored experience for mobile users, such as displaying mobile-specific UI elements or optimizing performance for touch interactions.\n\n```typescript\nif (isMobile()) {\n  // Display mobile-specific UI elements\n}\n```\n\nThe `flattenChildren` function is a useful utility for rendering nested React components. It takes a React node and flattens any nested child elements into a single array, which can simplify the process of rendering complex component hierarchies.\n\n```typescript\nconst flatChildren = flattenChildren(nestedReactNode);\n```\n\nLastly, the `truncatedAddress` function improves the readability of Ethereum addresses by truncating them to show only the first and last six characters.
